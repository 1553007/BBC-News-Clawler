Tilapia ( tih- LAH -pee-ə ) is the common name for nearly a hundred species of cichlid fish from the tilapiine cichlid tribe .
Tilapia are mainly freshwater fish inhabiting shallow streams, ponds, rivers, and lakes, and less commonly found living in brackish water .
Historically, they have been of major importance in artisanal fishing in Africa , and they are of increasing importance in aquaculture and aquaponics .
Tilapia can become a problematic invasive species in new warm-water habitats such as Australia , whether deliberately or accidentally introduced , but generally not in temperate climates due to their inability to survive in cold water.
Tilapia is the fourth-most consumed fish in the United States dating back to 2002.
The popularity of tilapia came about due to its low price, easy preparation, and mild taste.
Corps ( ; plural corps ; from French corps , from the Latin corpus body) is a term used for several different kinds of organisation.
A military innovation by Napoleon, the formation was first named as such in 1805.
Within military terminology a corps may be:
These usages often overlap.
Corps may also be a generic term for a non-military organization , such as the U.S. Peace Corps .
A preference is a technical term in psychology , economics and philosophy usually used in relation to choosing between alternatives.
For example, someone prefers A over B if they would rather choose A than B.
Preference can also be used in insolvency terms.
Dawn , from an Old English verb dagian : to become day, is the time that marks the beginning of twilight before sunrise .
It is recognized by the appearance of indirect sunlight being scattered in the atmosphere , when the centre of the Sun 's disc reaches 18° below the horizon .
This dawn twilight period will last until sunrise (when the Sun's upper limb breaks the horizon), as the diffused light becomes direct sunlight .
Rate or rates may refer to:
Work is a word generally embodying concepts associated with the labor, force, energy, and/or effort required to produce a specific result.

In biology , an organism (from Greek : ὀργανισμός, organismos ) is any individual entity that propagates the properties of life .
It is a synonym for life form .
Organisms are classified by taxonomy into specified groups such as the multicellular animals , plants , and fungi ; or unicellular microorganisms such as a protists , bacteria , and archaea .
All types of organisms are capable of reproduction , growth and development , maintenance , and some degree of response to stimuli .
Humans are multicellular animals composed of many trillions of cells which differentiate during development into specialized tissues and organs .
An organism may be either a prokaryote or a eukaryote .
Prokaryotes are represented by two separate domains – bacteria and archaea .
Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called organelles (such as mitochondria in animals and plants and plastids in plants and algae , all generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria).
Fungi, animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms within the eukaryotes.
Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which only about 1.2 million have been documented.
More than 99% of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived are estimated to be extinct .
In 2016, a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms was identified.

The stethoscope is an acoustic medical device for auscultation , or listening to the internal sounds of an animal or human body.
It typically has a small disc-shaped resonator that is placed against the skin, and one or two tubes connected to two earpieces.
A stethoscope can be used to listen to the sounds made by the heart , lungs or intestines , as well as blood flow in arteries and veins .
In combination with a manual sphygmomanometer , it is commonly used when measuring blood pressure .
Less commonly, mechanic's stethoscopes, equipped with rod shaped chestpieces, are used to listen to internal sounds made by machines (for example, sounds and vibrations emitted by worn ball bearings), such as diagnosing a malfunctioning automobile engine by listening to the sounds of its internal parts.
Stethoscopes can also be used to check scientific vacuum chambers for leaks, and for various other small-scale acoustic monitoring tasks.
A stethoscope that intensifies auscultatory sounds is called a phonendoscope .
The Internet ( portmanteau of interconnected network ) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.
It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.
The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail , telephony , and file sharing .
The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the federal government of the United States in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication with computer networks.
The primary precursor network, the ARPANET , initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s.
The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks.
The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal , and mobile computers were connected to the network.
Although the Internet was widely used by academia since the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.
Most traditional communication media, including telephony, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email , Internet telephony , Internet television , online music , digital newspapers, and video streaming websites.
Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to website technology, or are reshaped into blogging , web feeds and online news aggregators .
The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging , Internet forums , and social networking .
Online shopping has grown exponentially both for major retailers and small businesses and entrepreneurs , as it enables firms to extend their brick and mortar presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online .
Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries.
The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies.
The overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces in the Internet, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) space and the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.
In November 2006, the Internet was included on USA Today ' s list of New Seven Wonders .

Biodiversity is the variety and variability of life on Earth .
Biodiversity is typically a measure of variation at the genetic , species , and ecosystem level.
Terrestrial biodiversity is usually greater near the equator , which is the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity .
Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth , and is richest in the tropics.
These tropical forest ecosystems cover less than 10 percent of earth's surface, and contain about 90 percent of the world's species.
Marine biodiversity is usually highest along coasts in the Western Pacific , where sea surface temperature is highest, and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans.
There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity .
Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots , and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.
Rapid environmental changes typically cause mass extinctions .
More than 99.9 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth, amounting to over five billion species, are estimated to be extinct .
Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described.
More recently, in May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.
The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10 and weighs 50 billion tonnes .
In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 TtC (trillion tons of carbon ).
In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth.
The age of the Earth is about 4.54 billion years.
The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago, during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon.
There are microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia .
Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old meta-sedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland .
More recently, in 2015, remains of biotic life were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.
According to one of the researchers, If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ..
then it could be common in the universe .
Since life began on Earth , five major mass extinctions and several minor events have led to large and sudden drops in biodiversity.
The Phanerozoic eon (the last 540 million years) marked a rapid growth in biodiversity via the Cambrian explosion —a period during which the majority of multicellular phyla first appeared.
The next 400 million years included repeated, massive biodiversity losses classified as mass extinction events.
In the Carboniferous , rainforest collapse led to a great loss of plant and animal life.
The Permian–Triassic extinction event , 251 million years ago, was the worst; vertebrate recovery took 30 million years.
The most recent, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , occurred 65 million years ago and has often attracted more attention than others because it resulted in the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs .
The period since the emergence of humans has displayed an ongoing biodiversity reduction and an accompanying loss of genetic diversity .
Named the Holocene extinction , the reduction is caused primarily by human impacts , particularly habitat destruction.
Conversely, biodiversity positively impacts human health in a number of ways, although a few negative effects are studied.
The United Nations designated 2011–2020 as the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity .
and 2021-2030 as the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration According to a 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services by IPBES , 25% of plant and animal species are threatened with extinction as the result of human activity.
In production , research , retail , and accounting , a cost is the value of money that has been used up to produce something or deliver a service, and hence is not available for use anymore.
In business , the cost may be one of acquisition, in which case the amount of money expended to acquire it is counted as cost.
In this case, money is the input that is gone in order to acquire the thing.
This acquisition cost may be the sum of the cost of production as incurred by the original producer, and further costs of transaction as incurred by the acquirer over and above the price paid to the producer.
Usually, the price also includes a mark-up for profit over the cost of production.
More generalized in the field of economics , cost is a metric that is totaling up as a result of a process or as a differential for the result of a decision .
Hence cost is the metric used in the standard modeling paradigm applied to economic processes .
Costs (pl.) are often further described based on their timing or their applicability.
Night is the period in which the sun is below the horizon.

Charles is a masculine given name from the French form Charles of a Germanic name Karl .
The original Anglo-Saxon was Ċearl or Ċeorl , as the name of King Cearl of Mercia , that disappeared after the Norman conquest of England .
The name was notably borne by Charlemagne (Charles the Great), and was at the time Latinized as Karolus (as in Vita Karoli Magni ), later also as Carolus .
A party is a gathering of people who have been invited by a host for the purposes of socializing , conversation , recreation , or as part of a festival or other commemoration of a special occasion.
A party will typically feature food and beverages , and often music and dancing or other forms of entertainment .
In many Western countries, parties for teens and adults are associated with drinking alcohol such as beer , wine , or distilled spirits .
The human shoulder is made up of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles, ligaments and tendons.
The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints .
The shoulder joint , also known as the glenohumeral joint, is the major joint of the shoulder, but can more broadly include the acromioclavicular joint .
In human anatomy , the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula , and the head sits in the glenoid cavity .
The shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint.
The shoulder joint is the main joint of the shoulder.
It is a ball and socket joint that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body.
The joint capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint and attaches to the scapula , humerus , and head of the biceps .
It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane .
The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that surround the shoulder joint and contribute to the shoulder's stability.
The muscles of the rotator cuff are supraspinatus , subscapularis , infraspinatus , and teres minor .
The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches to the humeral head .
The shoulder must be mobile enough for the wide range actions of the arms and hands, but stable enough to allow for actions such as lifting, pushing, and pulling.

A microprocessor is a computer processor that incorporates the functions of a central processing unit on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits.
The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory and provides results as output.
Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic .
Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system .
The integration of a whole CPU onto a single or a few integrated circuits greatly reduced the cost of processing power.
Integrated circuit processors are produced in large numbers by highly automated processes , resulting in a low unit price .
Single-chip processors increase reliability because there are many fewer electrical connections that could fail.
As microprocessor designs improve, the cost of manufacturing a chip (with smaller components built on a semiconductor chip the same size) generally stays the same according to Rock's law .
Before microprocessors, small computers had been built using racks of circuit boards with many medium- and small-scale integrated circuits .
Microprocessors combined this into one or a few large-scale ICs. Continued increases in microprocessor capacity have since rendered other forms of computers almost completely obsolete (see history of computing hardware ), with one or more microprocessors used in everything from the smallest embedded systems and handheld devices to the largest mainframes and supercomputers .
Communication (from Latin communicare , meaning to share) is the act of conveying meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs , symbols , and semiotic rules.
The main steps inherent to all communication are:
The scientific study of communication can be divided into:
The channel of communication can be visual , auditory , tactile (such as in Braille ) and haptic , olfactory , electromagnetic , or biochemical .
Human communication is unique for its extensive use of abstract language .
Development of civilization has been closely linked with progress in telecommunication .
The horizon is the line at which the sky and the Earth's surface appear to meet.

Java ( Indonesian : Jawa ; Javanese : ꦗꦮ; Sundanese : ᮏᮝ ) is an island of Indonesia , bordered by the Indian Ocean on the south and the Java Sea on the north.
With a population of over 141 million (Java only) or 145 million (including the inhabitants of its surrounding islands), Java is the home to 56.7 percent of the Indonesian population and is the world's most populous island .
The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta , is located on its northwestern coast.
Much of Indonesian history took place on Java.
It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies .
Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s.
Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.
Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park , Borobudur Temple , Prambanan Temple , and Sangiran Early Man Site .
Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions from geologic subduction between Sunda Plate and Australian Plate , Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass at about 138,800 square kilometres (53,600 sq mi).
A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east–west spine along the island.
Three main languages are spoken on the island: Javanese , Sundanese , and Madurese , where Javanese is the most spoken; it is the native language of about 60 million Javanese people in Indonesia, most of whom live on Java.
Furthermore, most residents are bilingual , speaking Indonesian (the official language of Indonesia) as their first or second language.
While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim , Java's population comprises people of diverse religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.
Java is divided into four administrative provinces, West Java , Central Java , East Java , and Banten , and two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta .
In mathematics , a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is, generally speaking, an object similar to a line but that need not be straight .
Thus, a curve is a generalization of a line, in that it may be curved.
Intuitively, a curve may be thought as the trace left by a moving point .
This is the definition that appeared, more 2000 years, ago in Euclid's Elements : The curved line is … the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which … will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width.
This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: A curve is the image of a continuous function from an interval to a topological space .
In some context, the function that defines the curve is called a parametrization , and the curve is a parametric curve .
In this article, these curves are sometimes called topological curves for distinguishing them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves .
This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are level curves (which are unions of curves and isolated points), and algebraic curves (see below).
Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves , since they are generally defined by implicit equations .
Nevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot been drawn.
This is the case of space-filling curves and fractal curves .
For insuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable , and the curve is then said a differentiable curve .
A plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates .
More generally, an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one.
If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field k , the curve is said to be defined over k .
In the common case of a real algebraic curve , where k is the field of real numbers , an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves.
When complex zeros are considered, one has a complex algebraic curve , which, from the topologically point of view, is not a curve, but a surface , and is often called a Riemann surface .
Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied.
In particular, algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography .
A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation .
The term laser originated as an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation .
The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H.
Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories , based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow .
A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light coherently .
Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography .
Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances ( collimation ), enabling applications such as laser pointers and lidar .
Lasers can also have high temporal coherence , which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum , i.e., they can emit a single color of light.
Alternatively, temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light with a broad spectrum but durations as short as a femtosecond ( ultrashort pulses ).
Lasers are used in optical disk drives , laser printers , barcode scanners , DNA sequencing instruments , fiber-optic and free-space optical communication , laser surgery and skin treatments, cutting and welding materials, military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed, and in laser lighting displays for entertainment.
They have been used for car headlamps on luxury cars, by using a blue laser and a phosphor to produce highly directional white light.
Finance is a field that is concerned with the allocation ( investment ) of assets and liabilities over space and time, often under conditions of risk or uncertainty.
Finance can also be defined as the art of money management .
Participants in the market aim to price assets based on their risk level, fundamental value, and their expected rate of return .
Finance can be split into three sub-categories: public finance , corporate finance and personal finance .
Terrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentional violence, generally against civilians, for political purposes.
It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in context of war against non-combatants (mostly civilians and neutral military personnel ).
The terms terrorist and terrorism originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but gained mainstream popularity in the 1970s in news reports and books covering the conflicts in Northern Ireland , the Basque Country and Palestine .
The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. in 2001.
There are different definitions of terrorism .
Terrorism is a charged term .
It is often used with the connotation of something that is morally wrong.
Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups.
Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives.
These organizations include right-wing and left-wing political organizations, nationalist groups , religious groups , revolutionaries and ruling governments .
Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states.
When terrorism is perpetrated by nation-states it is not considered terrorism by the state conducting it , making legality a largely grey-area issue.
There is no consensus as to whether or not terrorism should be regarded as a war crime .
The Global Terrorism Database , maintained by the University of Maryland, College Park , has recorded more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths between 2000 and 2014.

Ghana ( ( listen ) ), officially the Republic of Ghana , is a country located along the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean , in the subregion of West Africa .
Spanning a land mass of 238,535 km (92,099 sq mi), Ghana is bordered by the Ivory Coast in the west, Burkina Faso in the north, Togo in the east and the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean in the south.
Ghana means Warrior King in the Soninke language .
The first permanent state in the territory of present-day Ghana dates back to the 11th century.
Numerous kingdoms and empires emerged over the centuries, of which the most powerful was the Kingdom of Ashanti .
Beginning in the 15th century, numerous European powers contested the area for trading rights, with the British ultimately establishing control of the coast by the late 19th century.
Following over a century of native resistance, Ghana's current borders were established by the 1900s as the British Gold Coast .
It became independent of the United Kingdom on 6 March 1957.
Ghana's population of approximately 30 million spans a variety of ethnic, linguistic and religious groups.
According to the 2010 census, 71.2% of the population was Christian , 17.6% was Muslim , and 5.2% practised traditional faiths.
Its diverse geography and ecology ranges from coastal savannahs to tropical rain forests .
Ghana is a unitary constitutional democracy led by a president who is both head of state and head of the government .
Ghana's growing economic prosperity and democratic political system have made it a regional power in West Africa.
It is a member of the Non-Aligned Movement , the African Union , the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Group of 24 (G24) and the Commonwealth of Nations .
A telephone (derived from the Greek : τῆλε , tēle , far and φωνή, phōnē , voice, together meaning distant voice), or phone , is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly.
A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice , into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user.
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice.
This instrument was further developed by many others.
The telephone was the first device in history that enabled people to talk directly with each other across large distances.
Telephones rapidly became indispensable to businesses, government and households.
The essential elements of a telephone are a microphone ( transmitter ) to speak into and an earphone ( receiver ) which reproduces the voice in a distant location.
In addition, most telephones contain a ringer to announce an incoming telephone call, and a dial or keypad to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone.
The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation.
The dial may be located either on the handset or on a base unit to which the handset is connected.
The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through a telephone network to the receiving telephone, which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a loudspeaker .
Telephones are duplex devices, meaning they permit transmission in both directions simultaneously.
The first telephones were directly connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location.
Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards .
These exchanges were soon connected together, eventually forming an automated, worldwide public switched telephone network .
For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the mid-20th century.
Hand-held mobile phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973.
In later decades their analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with greater capability and lower cost.
Convergence has given most modern cell phones capabilities far beyond simple voice conversation.
They may be able to record spoken messages , send and receive text messages , take and display photographs or video , play music or games , surf the Internet , do road navigation or immerse the user in virtual reality .
Since 1999, the trend for mobile phones is smartphones that integrate all mobile communication and computing needs.
Activism consists of efforts to promote, impede, direct, or intervene in social , political , economic , or environmental reform with the desire to make changes in society .
Forms of activism range from mandate building in the community (including writing letters to newspapers), petitioning elected officials , running or contributing to a political campaign, preferential patronage (or boycott ) of businesses, and demonstrative forms of activism like rallies , street marches , strikes , sit-ins , or hunger strikes .
Activism may be performed on a day-to-day basis in a wide variety of ways, including through the creation of art ( artivism ), computer hacking ( hacktivism ), or simply in how one chooses to spend their money ( economic activism ).
For example, the refusal to buy clothes or other merchandise from a company as a protest against the exploitation of workers by that company could be considered an expression of activism.
However, the most highly visible and impactful activism often comes in the form of collective action , in which numerous individuals coordinate an act of protest together in order to make a bigger impact.
Collective action that is purposeful, organized, and sustained over a period of time becomes known as a social movement .
Historically, activists have used literature, including pamphlets , tracts, and books to disseminate their messages and attempt to persuade their readers of the justice of their cause.
Research has now begun to explore how contemporary activist groups use social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action combining politics with technology .
The Online Etymology Dictionary records the English words activism and activist as in use in the political sense from the year 1920 or 1915 respectively.
In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority.
The term crime does not, in modern criminal law , have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.
The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law ; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law.
One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence ) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society or the state (a public wrong ).
Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.
The notion that acts such as murder , rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide.
What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country.
While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code , in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.
The state ( government ) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime.
In modern societies , there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere.
If found guilty , an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence , or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment , life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions , execution .
Usually, to be classified as a crime, the act of doing something criminal ( actus reus ) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the intention to do something criminal ( mens rea ).
While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.
Breaches of private law ( torts and breaches of contract ) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure .
Property , in the abstract , is what belongs to or with something, whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing.
In the context of this article, it is one or more components (rather than attributes), whether physical or incorporeal , of a person's estate ; or so belonging to, as in being owned by, a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a corporation or even a society .
Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to consume , alter, share, redefine , rent , mortgage , pawn , sell , exchange , transfer , give away or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things, as well as to perhaps abandon it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it (as a durable , mean or factor , or whatever), or at the very least exclusively keep it.
In economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property: private property , public property , and collective property (also called cooperative property).
Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways, whether simply or complexly, whether equally or unequally.
However, there is an expectation that each party's will (rather discretion) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional, so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent.
The parties might expect their wills to be unanimous , or alternately every given one of them, when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists, may expect his, her, its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute.
The Restatement (First) of Property defines property as anything, tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing.
This mediating relationship between individual, property and state is called a property regime.
In sociology and anthropology , property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object.
The distinction between collective property and private property is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.
Important widely recognized types of property include real property (the combination of land and any improvements to or on the land), personal property (physical possessions belonging to a person), private property (property owned by legal persons, business entities or individual natural persons), public property (state owned or publicly owned and available possessions) and intellectual property (exclusive rights over artistic creations, inventions , etc.), although the last is not always as widely recognized or enforced.
An article of property may have physical and incorporeal parts.
A title , or a right of ownership , establishes the relation between the property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit.
Wine is an alcoholic drink made from fermented grapes .
Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol , carbon dioxide , and heat.
Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine.
These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir , and the production process.
Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine.
These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.
Wines not made from grapes include rice wine and fruit wines such as plum , cherry , pomegranate , currant and elderberry .
Wine has been produced for thousands of years.
The earliest known traces of wine are from Georgia (c.
6000 BC), Iran (c.
5000 BC), and Sicily (c.
4000 BC) although there is evidence of a similar alcoholic drink being consumed earlier in China (c.
The earliest known winery is the 6,100-year-old Areni-1 winery in Armenia .
Wine reached the Balkans by 4500 BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient Greece , Thrace and Rome .
Throughout history, wine has been consumed for its intoxicating effects .
Wine has long played an important role in religion.
Red wine was associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians and was used by both the Greek cult of Dionysus and the Romans in their Bacchanalia ; Judaism also incorporates it in the Kiddush and Christianity in the Eucharist .
Letter , letters , or literature may refer to:
A conference is a meeting of people who confer about a topic.
Conference types include:
A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with commonality such as norms , religion , values , customs , or identity .
Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighbourhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms.
Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at large.
Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, community may also refer to large group affiliations such as national communities , international communities , and virtual communities .
The English-language word community derives from the Old French comuneté , which comes from the Latin communitas community, public spirit (from Latin communis , shared in common).
Human communities may share intent , belief , resources , preferences , needs , and risks in common, affecting the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.
Experience is the knowledge or mastery of an event or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it.
Terms in philosophy such as empirical knowledge or a posteriori knowledge are used to refer to knowledge based on experience.
A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an expert .
The concept of experience generally refers to know-how or procedural knowledge , rather than propositional knowledge : on-the-job training rather than book-learning.
The interrogation of experience has a long term tradition in continental philosophy.
Experience plays an important role in the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard .
The German term Erfahrung , often translated into English as experience, has a slightly different implication, connoting the coherency of life 's experiences.
Certain religious traditions (such as Buddhism , Surat Shabd Yoga , mysticism and Pentecostalism ) and educational paradigms with, for example, the conditioning of military recruit-training (also known as boot camps), stress the experiential nature of human epistemology .
This stands in contrast to alternatives: traditions of dogma , logic or reasoning .
Participants in activities such as tourism , extreme sports and recreational drug-use also tend to stress the importance of experience.
The history of the word experience aligns it closely with the concept of experiment .
A man is a male human.
The term man is usually reserved for an adult male, with the term boy being the usual term for a male child or adolescent.
However, the term man is also sometimes used to identify a male human, regardless of age, as in phrases such as men's basketball .
Like most other male mammals , a man's genome typically inherits an X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father.
The male fetus produces larger amounts of androgens and smaller amounts of estrogens than a female fetus.
This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.
During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics , thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes.
However, there are exceptions to the above for some transgender and intersex men.
A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of part or all of an organism, and that is not due to any external injury.
Diseases are often construed as medical conditions that are associated with specific symptoms and signs .
A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions.
For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency , hypersensitivity , allergies and autoimmune disorders .
In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain , dysfunction , distress , social problems , or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person.
In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries , disabilities , disorders , syndromes , infections , isolated symptoms , deviant behaviors , and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories.
Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life.
Death due to disease is called death by natural causes .
There are four main types of disease: infectious diseases , deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases ), and physiological diseases.
Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as communicable versus non-communicable diseases.
The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections .
In developed countries, the diseases that cause the most sickness overall are neuropsychiatric conditions , such as depression and anxiety .
The study of disease is called pathology , which includes the study of etiology , or cause.
In logic and philosophy , an argument is a series of statements (in a natural language ), called the premises or premisses (both spellings are acceptable), intended to determine the degree of truth of another statement, the conclusion.
The logical form of an argument in a natural language can be represented in a symbolic formal language , and independently of natural language formally defined arguments can be made in math and computer science.
Logic is the study of the forms of reasoning in arguments and the development of standards and criteria to evaluate arguments.
Deductive arguments can be valid or sound: in a valid argument, premisses necessitate the conclusion, even if one or more of the premisses is false and the conclusion is false; in a sound argument, true premisses necessitate a true conclusion.
Inductive arguments , by contrast, can have different degrees of logical strength: the stronger or more cogent the argument, the greater the probability that the conclusion is true, the weaker the argument, the lesser that probability.
The standards for evaluating non-deductive arguments may rest on different or additional criteria than truth—for example, the persuasiveness of so-called indispensability claims in transcendental arguments , the quality of hypotheses in retroduction , or even the disclosure of new possibilities for thinking and acting.
A boat is a watercraft of a large range of type and size.
Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on their larger size, shape, and cargo or passenger capacity, and their ability to carry boats.
Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes , or in protected coastal areas.
However, some boats, such as the whaleboat , were intended for use in an offshore environment.
In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship.
Anomalous definitions exist, as bulk freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes being known as oreboats .
Boats vary in proportion and construction methods due to their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions.
Canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport.
Fishing boats vary widely in style partly to match local conditions.
Pleasure craft used in recreational boating include ski boats, pontoon boats , and sailboats .
House boats may be used for vacationing or long-term residence.
Lighters are used to convey cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore.
Lifeboats have rescue and safety functions.
Boats can be propelled by manpower (e.g. rowboats and paddle boats ), wind (e.g. sailboats ), and motor (including gasoline , diesel , and electric).
Labs , labs , or LABS may carry the following meanings:
Categorization is something that humans and other organisms do : doing the right thing with the right kind of thing.
The doing can be nonverbal or verbal.
For humans, both concrete objects and abstract ideas are recognized, differentiated, and understood through categorization.
Objects are usually categorized for some adaptive or pragmatic purpose.
Categorization is grounded in the features that distinguish the category's members from nonmembers.
Categorization is important in learning, prediction, inference , decision making, language, and many forms of organisms' interaction with their environments.
There are many theories of categorization, among them:
Ho Chi Minh City ( Vietnamese : Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh ; tʰàjŋ̟ fǒ hò cǐ mīŋ̟ ( listen ) or tʰàn fǒ hò cǐ mɨ̄n ), also known by its former name of Saigon ( Vietnamese : Sài Gòn ; sàj ɣɔ̀n or ʂàj ɣɔ̀ŋ ), is the most populous city in Vietnam with a population of 8.4 million (13 million in the metropolitan area ) as of 2017.
Located in southeast Vietnam, the metropolis surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles).
From 1955 to 1975, Saigon was the capital of the Republic of Vietnam, commonly known as South Vietnam .
Ho Chi Minh City is the financial centre of Vietnam and is classified as a Beta+ World City by Globalization and World Cities Research Network .
It is home to the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange , the largest stock exchange by total market capitalization in Vietnam and the headquarters of many national and international banks and companies.
A major air travel gateway to Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City is its most visited city, with 6.3 million visitors in 2017.
Many of the city's historical landmarks which are well known to international visitors include the Bến Thành Market , Ho Chi Minh City Hall , Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica of Saigon , Independence Palace and the Municipal Theatre .
The main passenger airport serving the metropolitan area is Tan Son Nhat International Airport , it is the busiest airport in Vietnam handling 36 million passengers in 2017.
Trojan or Trojans may refer to:
A password , sometimes called a passcode , is a memorized secret used to confirm the identity of a user.
Using the terminology of the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines, the secret is memorized by a party called the claimant while the party verifying the identity of the claimant is called the verifier .
When the claimant successfully demonstrates knowledge of the password to the verifier through an established authentication protocol , the verifier is able to infer the claimants identity.
In general, a password is an arbitrary string of characters including letters, digits, or other symbols.
If the permissible characters are constrained to be numeric, the corresponding secret is sometimes called a personal identification number (PIN).
Despite its name, a password need not be an actual word; indeed a non-word (in the dictionary sense) may be harder to guess, which is a desirable property of passwords.
A memorized secret consisting of a sequence of words or other text separated by spaces is sometimes called a passphrase .
A passphrase is similar to a password in usage but the former is generally longer for added security.
Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera ; with their forelimbs adapted as wings , they are the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight .
Bats are more manoeuvrable than birds , flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium .
The smallest bat, and arguably the smallest extant mammal, is Kitti's hog-nosed bat , which is 29–34 mm (1.14–1.34 in) in length, 15 cm (5.91 in) across the wings and 2–2.6 g (0.07–0.09 oz) in mass.
The largest bats are the flying foxes and the giant golden-crowned flying fox , Acerodon jubatus , which can weigh 1.6 kg (4 lb) and have a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in).
The second largest order of mammals, bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with over 1,200 species.
These were traditionally divided into two suborders: the largely fruit-eating megabats , and the echolocating microbats .
But more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera , with megabats as members of the former along with several species of microbats.
Many bats are insectivores , and most of the rest are frugivores (fruit-eaters).
A few species feed on animals other than insects; for example, the vampire bats feed on blood .
Most bats are nocturnal , and many roost in caves or other refuges; it is uncertain whether bats have these behaviours to escape predators .
Bats are present throughout the world, with the exception of extremely cold regions.
They are important in their ecosystems for pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds; many tropical plants depend entirely on bats for these services.
Bats provide humans with some benefits, at the cost of some threats.
Bat dung has been mined as guano from caves and used as fertiliser.
Bats consume insect pests, reducing the need for pesticides .
They are sometimes numerous enough to serve as tourist attractions, and are used as food across Asia and the Pacific Rim .
They are natural reservoirs of many pathogens , such as rabies ; and since they are highly mobile, social, and long-lived, they can readily spread disease.
In many cultures, bats are popularly associated with darkness, malevolence, witchcraft, vampires , and death.

Confetti are small pieces or streamers of paper , mylar , or metallic material which are usually thrown at celebrations , especially parades and weddings .
The origins are from the Latin confectum , with confetti the plural of Italian confetto , small sweet.
Modern paper confetti trace back to symbolic rituals of tossing grains and sweets during special occasions, traditional for numerous cultures throughout history as an ancient custom dating back to pagan times, but adapted from sweets and grains to paper through the centuries.
Confetti are made in a variety of colors, and commercially available confetti come in many different shapes.
A distinction is made between confetti and glitter ; glitter is smaller than confetti (pieces usually no larger than 1mm) and is universally shiny.
Most table confetti are also shiny.
While they are called metallic confetti they are actually metallized PVC.
The most popular shape is the star .
Seasonally, Snowflake Confetti are the most requested shape .
Most party supply stores carry paper and metallic confetti.
Confetti are commonly used at social gatherings such as parties, weddings, and Bar Mitzvahs , but are often considered taboo at funerals, due to the somber atmosphere.
The simplest confetti are simply shredded paper (see ticker-tape parade ), and can be made with scissors or a paper shredder .
Other confetti often consist of chads punched out of scrap paper.
A hole punch can be used to make small round chads.
For more elaborate chads, a ticket punch can be used.
Most pieces of paper flats will flutter as tumblewings giving flight times because of gliding aerodynamics.
In recent years the use of confetti as a cosmetic addition to trophy presentations at sporting events has become increasingly common.
In this case, larger strips of paper (typically measuring 20 mm × 60 mm) in the colors appropriate to the team or celebration are used.
For smaller volumes of confetti, ABS or PVC barrels are filled and the confetti is projected via a cannon (a small pressure vessel ) using compressed air or carbon dioxide .
For larger venues or volumes of confetti, a venturi air mover powered by carbon dioxide is used to propel significantly larger volumes of confetti greater distances.
Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease -causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to the infectious agents and the toxins they produce.
Infectious disease , also known as transmissible disease or communicable disease , is illness resulting from an infection.
Infections are caused by infectious agents ( pathogens ) including:
Hosts can fight infections using their immune system .
Mammalian hosts react to infections with an innate response, often involving inflammation , followed by an adaptive response.
Specific medications used to treat infections include antibiotics , antivirals , antifungals , antiprotozoals , and antihelminthics .
Infectious diseases resulted in 9.2 million deaths in 2013 (about 17% of all deaths).
The branch of medicine that focuses on infections is referred to as infectious disease .
Telephony ( tə- LEF -ə-nee ) is the field of technology involving the development, application, and deployment of telecommunication services for the purpose of electronic transmission of voice, fax, or data, between distant parties.
The history of telephony is intimately linked to the invention and development of the telephone .
Telephony is commonly referred to as the construction or operation of telephones and telephonic systems and as a system of telecommunications in which telephonic equipment is employed in the transmission of speech or other sound between points, with or without the use of wires.
The term is also used frequently to refer to computer hardware, software, and computer network systems, that perform functions traditionally performed by telephone equipment.
In this context the technology is specifically referred to as Internet telephony, or voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).
Relative may refer to:
A tendon or sinew is a tough band of fibrous connective tissue that usually connects muscle to bone and is capable of withstanding tension .
Tendons are similar to ligaments ; both are made of collagen .
Ligaments join one bone to bone, while tendons connect muscle to bone for a proper functioning of the body.
A day is approximately the period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis.
A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times.
In 1960, the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in year 1900, and was designated the SI base unit of time .
The unit of measurement day, was redefined as 86,400 SI seconds and symbolized d .
In 1967, the second and so the day were redefined by atomic electron transition .
A civil day is usually 86,400 seconds, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time .
Day can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods, reckoned from one midnight to the next, into which a week, month, or year is divided, and corresponding to a rotation of the earth on its axis.
However its use depends on its context, for example when people say 'day and night ', 'day' will have a different meaning.
It will mean the interval of light between two successive nights; the time between sunrise and sunset , in this instance 'day' will mean time of light between one night and the next.
However, in order to be clear when using 'day' in that sense, daytime should be used to distinguish it from day referring to a 24-hour period; this is since daytime usually always means 'the time of the day between sunrise and sunset.
The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date , as in answer to the question, On which day?
The life patterns ( circadian rhythms ) of humans and many other species are related to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle.
A tool is an object used to extend the ability of an individual to modify features of the surrounding environment.
Although many animals use simple tools , only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia , use tools to make other tools.
The set of tools needed to perform different tasks that are part of the same activity is called gear or equipment .
While one may apply the term tool loosely to many things that are means to an end (e.g., a fork ), strictly speaking an object is a tool only if, besides being constructed to be held, it is also made of a material that allows its user to apply to it various degrees of force.
If repeated use wears part of the tool down (like a knife blade), it may be possible to restore it; if it wears the tool out or breaks it, the tool must be replaced.
Thus tool falls under the taxonomic category implement , and is on the same taxonomic rank as instrument , utensil , device , or ware.
A baseline is a line that is a base for measurement or for construction .
The word baseline may refer to:
The name Baseline may refer to:
It may also refer to:
The past is the set of all events that occurred before a given point in time.
The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future .
The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time , and is accessed through memory and recollection .
In addition, human beings have recorded the past since the advent of written language.
The first known use of the word past was in the fourteenth century; it developed as the past participle of the middle English verb passen meaning to pass.
Wind is the flow of gases on a large scale.
On the surface of the Earth, wind consists of the bulk movement of air.
In outer space , solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space.
Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale , their speed , the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect.
The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn .
Winds have various aspects: velocity ( wind speed ); the density of the gas involved; energy content or wind energy .
Wind is also an important means of transportation for seeds and small birds; with time things can travel thousands of miles in the wind.
In meteorology , winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing.
Short bursts of high-speed wind are termed gusts.
Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls .
Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as breeze , gale , storm , and hurricane .
Wind occurs on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth.
The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet ( Coriolis effect ).
Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations.
In coastal areas the sea breeze /land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.
In human civilization, the concept of wind has been explored in mythology , influenced the events of history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a power source for mechanical work, electricity and recreation.
Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans.
Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption.
Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft.
When winds become strong, trees and human-made structures are damaged or destroyed.
Winds can shape landforms, via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils, such as loess , and by erosion .
Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds ; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions.
Wind also affects the spread of wildfires .
Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations.
When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock.
Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.
A week is a time unit equal to seven days .
It is the standard time period used for cycles of rest days in most parts of the world, mostly alongside—although not strictly part of—the Gregorian calendar .
In many languages, the days of the week are named after classical planets or gods of a pantheon .
In English, the names are Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , Saturday and Sunday .
Such a week may be called a planetary week .
This is in contrast to the lunar week in the Bible in which the seven days are simply numbered with seventh day being kept as a sabbath day.
While e.g. the US, Canada, Japan and Australia consider Sunday as the first day of the week, and while the week begins with Saturday in much of the Middle East, the international ISO 8601 standard has Monday as the first day of the week.
The ISO standard includes the ISO week date system, a numbering system for weeks within a given year, where each week beginning on a Monday is associated with the year that contains that week's Thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend Friday–Sunday, week number one of the year will start after that).
ISO 8601 assigns numbers to the days of the week, running from 1 to 7 for Monday through to Sunday.
The term week is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days, such as the nundinal cycle of the ancient Roman calendar, the work week, or school week referring only to the days spent on those activities.
A residence is an establishment where it was originally or currently being used by a host as their main place of dwelling or home.
Architecturally, a residence is typically a house, mansion, cottage or grand castles and palaces.
A residence is offered to travelers as temporary lodgings where they can rent a room.
The rooms are generally furnished in the style which complements the architecture type of the building.
This boutique type of accommodation has a nice homely feel where the traveler is the 'house-guest'.
Hotels, especially the extended stay chains, commonly function as residences for many guests.
Residence may more specifically refer to:
A fairy (also fata , fay , fey , fae , fair folk ; from faery , faerie , realm of the fays ) is a type of mythical being or legendary creature in European folklore (and particularly Celtic , Slavic , German , English , and French folklore), a form of spirit , often described as metaphysical , supernatural , or preternatural .
Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single origin, but are rather a collection of folk beliefs from disparate sources.
Various folk theories about the origins of fairies include casting them as either demoted angels or demons in a Christian tradition, as minor deities in pre-Christian Pagan belief systems, as spirits of the dead, as prehistoric precursors to humans , or as elementals .
The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific magical creatures with human appearance, small stature, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery.
At other times it has been used to describe any magical creature, such as goblins and gnomes .
Fairy has at times been used as an adjective, with a meaning equivalent to enchanted or magical.
A recurring motif of legends about fairies is the need to ward off fairies using protective charms.
Common examples of such charms include church bells, wearing clothing inside out, four-leaf clover , and food.
Fairies were also sometimes thought to haunt specific locations, and to lead travelers astray using will-o'-the-wisps .
Before the advent of modern medicine , fairies were often blamed for sickness, particularly tuberculosis and birth deformities .
In addition to their folkloric origins, fairies were a common feature of Renaissance literature and Romantic art , and were especially popular in the United Kingdom during the Victorian and Edwardian eras.
The Celtic Revival also saw fairies established as a canonical part of Celtic cultural heritage.
Francisco is the Spanish and Portuguese form of the masculine given name Franciscus (corresponding to English Francis ).
In Spanish , people with the name Francisco are sometimes nicknamed Paco : San Francisco de Asís was known as Pater Comunitatis (The Community father) when he founded the Franciscan order, Paco is a short form of Pater Comunitatis.
Also, in Spanish Latin America and in the Philippines, people with the name Francisco are called Pancho .
Kiko is also used as a nickname in the Philippines.
Chicho is another possible nickname.
In Portuguese , people named Francisco are commonly nicknamed Chico ( shíco ).
This is also a less-common nickname for Francisco in Spanish too.

Rapping (or rhyming , spitting , emceeing , MCing ) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular, which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backing beat or musical accompaniment.
The components of rap include content (what is being said), flow ( rhythm , rhyme ), and delivery ( cadence, tone).
Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track.
Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music , but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture.
The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which oral historians, or praise-singers, would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to praise or critique individuals.
Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali 's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets .
Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the Black rhetorical continuum, and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies.
The person credited with originating the style of delivering rhymes over extensive music, that would become known as rap, was Anthony DJ Hollywood Holloway from Harlem , New York.
Rap is usually delivered over a beat , typically provided by a DJ , turntablist , beatboxer , or performed a cappella without accompaniment.
Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing .
The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant to lightly strike, and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee.
The word had been used in British English since the 16th century.
It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning to converse, and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style.
Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.

The career is an individual's metaphorical journey through learning, work and other aspects of life .
There are a number of ways to define career and the term is used in a variety of ways.
An artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts , or demonstrating an art.
The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only.
The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors).
Artiste (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context; this use is becoming rare.
Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.
A prison , also known as a correctional facility , jail , gaol (dated, British and Australian English), penitentiary ( American English ), detention center ( American English ), remand center , or internment facility (commonly used term in military theatres of war/involvement), is a facility in which inmates are forcibly confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state .
Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial ; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment.
In simplest terms, a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed.
Prisons can also be used as a tool of political repression by authoritarian regimes.
Their perceived opponents may be imprisoned for political crimes , often without trial or other legal due process ; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice.
In times of war, prisoners of war or detainees may be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps , and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps .
In American English , prison and jail are usually treated as having separate definitions.
The term prison or penitentiary tends to describe institutions that incarcerate people for longer periods of time, such as many years, and are operated by the state or federal governments.
The term jail tends to describe institutions for confining people for shorter periods of time (e.g. for shorter sentences or pre-trial detention ) and are usually operated by local governments.
Outside of North America, prison and jail have the same meaning.
Common slang terms for a prison include: the pokey, the slammer, the can, the clink, the joint, the calaboose, the hoosegow and the big house.
Slang terms for imprisonment include: behind bars, in stir and up the river (a possible reference to Sing Sing ).
A patient is any recipient of health care services.
The patient is most often ill or injured and in need of treatment by a physician , nurse , psychologist , dentist , veterinarian , or other health care provider .
Worlds is a collection of science fiction and fantasy short stories by Eric Flint .
It was first published in hardcover and ebook format by Baen Books on February 1, 2009; a paperback edition was issued by the same publisher in October 2011.
The collection consists of ten short works of fiction, together with a preface, introductory notes introducing the individual stories and a bibliography of the author's works.
A phenomenon ( Greek : φαινόμενον, phainómenon , from the verb φαίνειν, phainein , to show, shine, appear, to be manifest or manifest itself, plural phenomena ) is an observable fact or event
The term came into its modern philosophical usage through Immanuel Kant , who contrasted it with the noumenon .
In contrast to a phenomenon, a noumenon cannot be directly observed.
Kant was heavily influenced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in this part of his philosophy, in which phenomenon and noumenon serve as interrelated technical terms.
Far predating this, the ancient Greek Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus also used phenomenon and noumenon as interrelated technical terms.
Acidosis is a process causing increased acidity in the blood and other body tissues (i.e., an increased hydrogen ion concentration ).
If not further qualified, it usually refers to acidity of the blood plasma .
The term acidemia describes the state of low blood pH, while acidosis is used to describe the processes leading to these states.
Nevertheless, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.
The distinction may be relevant where a patient has factors causing both acidosis and alkalosis, wherein the relative severity of both determines whether the result is a high, low, or normal pH.
Acidemia is said to occur when arterial pH falls below 7.35 (except in the fetus – see below), while its counterpart ( alkalemia ) occurs at a pH over 7.45.
Arterial blood gas analysis and other tests are required to separate the main causes.
The rate of cellular metabolic activity affects and, at the same time, is affected by the pH of the body fluids.
In mammals, the normal pH of arterial blood lies between 7.35 and 7.50 depending on the species (e.g., healthy human-arterial blood pH varies between 7.35 and 7.45).
Blood pH values compatible with life in mammals are limited to a pH range between 6.8 and 7.8. Changes in the pH of arterial blood (and therefore the extracellular fluid) outside this range result in irreversible cell damage.
Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans , United States.
It originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime .
Jazz is seen by many as America's classical music.
Since the 1920s Jazz Age , jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression.
It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation.
Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes , call and response vocals , polyrhythms and improvisation .
Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression , and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime , as well as European military band music.
Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as one of America's original art forms.
As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles.
New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles , biguine , ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation .
In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands , Kansas City jazz , a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles.
Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging musician's music which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation.
Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.
The 1950s saw the emergence of free jazz , which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures, and in the mid-1950s, hard bop emerged, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues , gospel , and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing.
Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode , or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation.
Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music 's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound.
In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay.
Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz .
A chemical substance is a form of matter having constant chemical composition and characteristic properties.
A chemical substance cannot be separated into its constituent elements by physical separation methods, i.e., without breaking chemical bonds .
Chemical substances can be simple substances , chemical compounds , or alloys .
Chemical elements may or may not be included in the definition, depending on expert viewpoint.
Chemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from mixtures .
A common example of a chemical substance is pure water ; it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory .
Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are diamond (carbon), gold , table salt ( sodium chloride ) and refined sugar ( sucrose ).
However, in practice, no substance is entirely pure, and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical.
Chemical substances exist as solids , liquids , gases , or plasma , and may change between these phases of matter with changes in temperature or pressure .
Chemical substances may be combined or converted to others by means of chemical reactions .
Forms of energy , such as light and heat , are not matter, and are thus not substances in this regard.
In economics , demand is the quantity of a good that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given period of time.
The relationship between price and quantity demanded is also known as the demand curve .
Preferences which underlie demand, are influenced by cost, benefit, odds and other variables.

Humans ( Homo sapiens ) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina .
Together with chimpanzees , gorillas , and orangutans , they are part of the family Hominidae (the great apes, or hominids ).
A terrestrial animal , humans are characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion ; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals ; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications ; larger, more complex brains than other animals; and highly advanced and organized societies .
Early hominins—particularly the australopithecines , whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes —are less often referred to as human than hominins of the genus Homo .
Several of these hominins used fire , occupied much of Eurasia , and gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago.
Humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago, and in several waves of migration , they ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world.
The spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected much of the biosphere and millions of species worldwide.
Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a larger brain with a well-developed neocortex , prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes , which enable advanced abstract reasoning , language , problem solving , sociality , and culture through social learning.
Humans use tools more frequently and effectively than any other animal; and are the only extant species to build fires, cook food , clothe themselves, and create and use numerous other technologies and arts .
Humans uniquely use such systems of symbolic communication as language and art to express themselves and exchange ideas, and also organize themselves into purposeful groups.
Humans create complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states .
Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values, social norms , and rituals , which together undergird human society.
Curiosity and the human desire to understand and influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena (or events) have motivated humanity's development of science , philosophy , mythology , religion , anthropology , and numerous other fields of knowledge.
Though most of human existence has been sustained by hunting and gathering in band societies , increasingly many human societies transitioned to sedentary agriculture approximately some 10,000 years ago, domesticating plants and animals, thus enabling the growth of civilization .
These human societies subsequently expanded, establishing various forms of government, religion, and culture around the world, and unifying people within regions to form states and empires.
The rapid advancement of scientific and medical understanding in the 19th and 20th centuries permitted the development of fuel-driven technologies and increased lifespans, causing the human population to rise exponentially.
The global human population was estimated to be near 7.7 billion in 2019.
Sunset , also known as sundown , is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon due to Earth's rotation .
As viewed from the Equator , the equinox Sun sets exactly due west in both spring and fall.
As viewed from the middle latitudes , the local summer Sun sets to the northwest for the Northern Hemisphere , but to the southwest for the Southern Hemisphere .
The time of sunset is defined in astronomy as the moment when the upper limb of the Sun disappears below the horizon.
Near the horizon, atmospheric refraction causes sunlight rays to be distorted to such an extent that geometrically the solar disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when a sunset is observed.
Sunset is distinct from twilight , which is divided into three stages, the first being civil twilight, which begins once the Sun has disappeared below the horizon, and continues until it descends to 6 degrees below the horizon; the second phase is nautical twilight, between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon; and the third is astronomical twilight, which is the period when the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon.
Dusk is at the very end of astronomical twilight, and is the darkest moment of twilight just before night .
Night occurs when the Sun reaches 18 degrees below the horizon and no longer illuminates the sky.
Locations further north than the Arctic Circle and further south than the Antarctic Circle experience no full sunset or sunrise on at least one day of the year, when the polar day or the polar night persists continuously for 24 hours.
Sunset creates unique atmospheric conditions such as the often intense orange and red colors of the Sun and the surrounding sky.
Nature , in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe .
Nature can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.
The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science .
Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura , or essential qualities, innate disposition, and in ancient times, literally meant birth.
Natura is a Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.
The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe , is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since.
This usage continued during the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries.
Within the various uses of the word today, nature often refers to geology and wildlife .
Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth .
It is often taken to mean the natural environment or wilderness —wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention.
For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, human nature or the whole of nature.
This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind .
Depending on the particular context, the term natural might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural .
Learning is the process of acquiring new, or modifying existing, knowledge , behaviors , skills , values , or preferences .
The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some machines ; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in some plants.
Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulates from repeated experiences.
The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be lost from that which cannot be retrieved.
Humans learn before birth and continue until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between people and their environment.
The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many fields, including educational psychology , neuropsychology , experimental psychology , and pedagogy .
Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning.
For example, learning may occur as a result of habituation , or classical conditioning , operant conditioning or as a result of more complex activities such as play , seen only in relatively intelligent animals.
Learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness.
Learning that an aversive event can't be avoided nor escaped may result in a condition called learned helplessness .
There is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally , in which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation , indicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in development .
Play has been approached by several theorists as the first form of learning.
Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play.
Lev Vygotsky agrees that play is pivotal for children's development, since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games.
Surgery is a medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as a disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas.
The act of performing surgery may be called a surgical procedure , operation , or simply surgery.
In this context, the verb operate means to perform surgery.
The adjective surgical means pertaining to surgery; e.g. surgical instruments or surgical nurse .
The patient or subject on which the surgery is performed can be a person or an animal.
A surgeon is a person who practices surgery and a surgeon's assistant is a person who practices surgical assistance.
A surgical team is made up of surgeon, surgeon's assistant , anaesthetist, circulating nurse and surgical technologist .
Surgery usually spans minutes to hours, but it is typically not an ongoing or periodic type of treatment.
The term surgery can also refer to the place where surgery is performed, or, in British English, simply the office of a physician , dentist , or veterinarian .
A ball is a round object (usually spherical , but can sometimes be ovoid ) with various uses.
It is used in ball games , where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players.
Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch or juggling .
Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings .
Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles .
Although many types of balls are today made from rubber , this form was unknown outside the Americas until after the voyages of Columbus .
The Spanish were the first Europeans to see the bouncing rubber balls (although solid and not inflated) which were employed most notably in the Mesoamerican ballgame .
Balls used in various sports in other parts of the world prior to Columbus were made from other materials such as animal bladders or skins, stuffed with various materials.
As balls are one of the most familiar spherical objects to humans, the word ball may be used to refer to or describe spherical or near-spherical objects.
Ball is used metaphorically sometimes to denote something spherical or spheroid, e.g., armadillos and human beings curl up into a ball, we make a ball with our fist.
Coat may refer to:
Indian or Indians refers to people or things related to India , or to the indigenous people of the Americas, or Aboriginal Australians until the 19th century.
Brian (sometimes spelled Bryan in English) is a male given name of Irish and Breton origin, as well as a surname of Occitan origin.
It is common in the English-speaking world .
It is possible that the name is derived from an Old Celtic word meaning high or noble.
For example, the element bre means hill; which could be transferred to mean eminence or exalted one.
The name is quite popular in Ireland, on account of Brian Boru , a 10th-century High King of Ireland .
The name was also quite popular in East Anglia during the Middle Ages .
This is because the name was introduced to England by Bretons following the Norman Conquest .
Bretons also settled in Ireland along with the Normans in the 12th century, and 'their' name was mingled with the 'Irish' version.
Also, in the north-west of England, the 'Irish' name was introduced by Scandinavian settlers from Ireland.
Within the Gaelic speaking areas of Scotland, the name was at first only used by professional families of Irish origin.
It was the fourth most popular male name in England and Wales in 1934, but a sharp decline followed over the remainder of the 20th century and by 1994 it had fallen out of the top 100.
It retained its popularity in the United States for longer; its most popular period there was from 1968–1979 when it consistently ranked between eighth and tenth.
The name has become increasingly popular in South America - particularly Argentina and Uruguay since the early 1990s.
The surname Brian is sometimes an English and Irish variant spelling of the surname Bryan .
The English and French surname Brian is sometimes derived from the personal Celtic personal name shown above.
The surname Brian can also sometimes be a French surname; derived from the Old Occitan word brian , meaning maggot and used as a nickname .
Variants of the name include Briant, Brien, Bran , Brion , Bryan , Bryant , Brjánn (in Icelandic) and Bryon.
Variant spellings such as Brien are sometimes used as female given names, especially among members of the Irish diaspora .
A student is primarily a person enrolled in a school or other educational institution who attends classes in a course to attain the appropriate level of mastery of a subject under the guidance of an instructor and who devotes time outside class to do whatever activities the instructor assigns that are necessary either for class preparation or to submit evidence of progress towards that mastery.
In the broader sense, a student is anyone who applies themselves to the intensive intellectual engagement with some matter necessary to master it as part of some practical affair in which such mastery is basic or decisive.
In the United Kingdom and India, the term student denotes those enrolled in secondary schools and higher (e.g., college or university ); those enrolled in primary/elementary schools are called pupils.

Fish are gill -bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits .
They form a sister group to the tunicates , together forming the olfactores .
Included in this definition are the living hagfish , lampreys , and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups.
Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes , so cladistically they are fish as well.
However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry).
Because in this manner the term fish is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology , unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods.
The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes ) is considered a typological , but not a phylogenetic classification.
The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period.
Although they lacked a true spine , they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts.
Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms.
Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators.
The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks ) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods .
Most fish are ectothermic (cold-blooded), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature .
Fish can communicate in their underwater environments through the use of acoustic communication.
Acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another.
The production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.
The sounds emitted by fish can vary depending on the species and stimulus involved.
They can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder.
Fish are abundant in most bodies of water.
They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon ) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish ), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of the ocean.
With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.
Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially as food .
Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing) or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture ).
They are also caught by recreational fishers , kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers , and exhibited in public aquaria .
Fish have had a role in culture through the ages, serving as deities , religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.

In philosophy , ideas are usually taken as mental representational images of some object .
Ideas can also be abstract concepts that do not present as mental images.
Many philosophers have considered ideas to be a fundamental ontological category of being .
The capacity to create and understand the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of human beings .
In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious reflection , for example, when we talk about the idea of a person or a place.
A new or original idea can often lead to innovation .
Scott may refer to:
Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals.
Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell.
Muscles function to produce force and motion .
They are primarily responsible for maintaining and changing posture , locomotion , as well as movement of internal organs , such as the contraction of the heart and the movement of food through the digestive system via peristalsis .
Muscle tissues are derived from the mesodermal layer of embryonic germ cells in a process known as myogenesis .
There are three types of muscle, skeletal or striated, cardiac , and smooth .
Muscle action can be classified as being either voluntary or involuntary.
Cardiac and smooth muscles contract without conscious thought and are termed involuntary, whereas the skeletal muscles contract upon command.
Skeletal muscles in turn can be divided into fast and slow twitch fibers.
Muscles are predominantly powered by the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates , but anaerobic chemical reactions are also used, particularly by fast twitch fibers.
These chemical reactions produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules that are used to power the movement of the myosin heads.
The term muscle is derived from the Latin musculus meaning little mouse perhaps because of the shape of certain muscles or because contracting muscles look like mice moving under the skin.
Equity may refer to:
A need is something that is necessary for an organism to live a healthy life .
Needs are distinguished from wants in that, in the case of a need, a deficiency causes a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death.
In other words, a need is something required for a safe, stable and healthy life (e.g. air , water , food , land , shelter ) while a want is a desire, wish or aspiration.
When needs or wants are backed by purchasing power , they have the potential to become economic demands .
Basic needs such as air, water, food and protection from environmental dangers are necessary for an organism to live.
In addition to basic needs, humans also have needs of a social or societal nature such as the human need to socialise or belong to a family unit or group.
Needs can be objective and physical , such as the need for food, or psychological and subjective , such as the need for self-esteem .
Needs and wants are a matter of interest in, and form a common substrate for, the fields of philosophy , biology , psychology , social science , economics , marketing and politics .
Field may refer to:
A number is a mathematical object used to count , measure , and label .
The original examples are the natural numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and so forth.
A written symbol like 5 that represents a number is called a numeral.
A numeral system is an organized way to write and manipulate this type of symbol, for example the Hindu–Arabic numeral system allows combinations of numerical digits like 5 and 0 to represent larger numbers like 50.
A numeral in linguistics can refer to a symbol like 5, the words or phrase that names a number, like five hundred, or other words that mean a specific number, like dozen.
In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers ), for ordering (as with serial numbers ), and for codes (as with ISBNs ).
In common usage, number may refer to a symbol, a word or phrase, or the mathematical object.
In mathematics , the notion of number has been extended over the centuries to include 0 , negative numbers , rational numbers such as 1 / 2 and − 2 / 3 , real numbers such as √ 2 and π , and complex numbers , which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by addition and multiplication).
Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations , the most familiar being addition , subtraction , multiplication , division , and exponentiation .
Their study or usage is called arithmetic .
The same term may also refer to number theory , the study of the properties of numbers.
Besides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world.
For example, in Western society, the number 13 is regarded as unlucky, and a million may signify a lot.
Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience , belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology , permeated ancient and medieval thought.
Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics , stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.
During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers and may be seen as extending the concept.
Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers , which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system.
Today, number systems are considered important special examples of much more general categories such as rings and fields , and the application of the term number is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.
Standard may refer to:
A diuretic is any substance that promotes diuresis , the increased production of urine .
This includes forced diuresis .
There are several categories of diuretics.
All diuretics increase the excretion of water from bodies, although each class does so in a distinct way.
Alternatively, an antidiuretic , such as vasopressin ( antidiuretic hormone ), is an agent or drug which reduces the excretion of water in urine.
Rights are legal , social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement ; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.
Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics , especially theories of justice and deontology .
Rights are often considered fundamental to civilization , for they are regarded as established pillars of society and culture , and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development.
According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy , rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws , and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived.
Fan commonly refers to:
Fan or fans may also refer to:

Pill or The Pill may refer to:
An airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport.
Airports often have facilities to store and maintain aircraft , and a control tower .
An airport consists of a landing area , which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off or a helipad , and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers , hangars and terminals .
Larger airports may have airport aprons , taxiway bridges , air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges , and emergency services .
In some countries, the US in particular, they also typically have one or more fixed-base operators , serving general aviation.
An airport solely serving helicopters is called a heliport .
An airport for use by seaplanes and amphibious aircraft is called a seaplane base .
Such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for takeoffs and landings , and seaplane docks for tying-up.
An international airport has additional facilities for customs and passport control as well as incorporating all of the aforementioned elements.
Such airports rank among the most complex and largest of all built typologies with 15 of the top 50 buildings by floor area being airport terminals.
An individual is that which exists as a distinct entity .
Individuality (or self-hood) is the state or quality of being an individual; particularly of being a person separate from other people and possessing their own needs or goals , rights and responsibilities .
The exact definition of an individual is important in the fields of biology , law , and philosophy .
From the 15th century and earlier (and also today within the fields of statistics and metaphysics ) individual meant indivisible , typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning a person.
From the 17th century on, individual indicates separateness, as in individualism .
Although individuality and individualism are commonly considered to mature with age/time and experience/wealth, a sane adult human being is usually considered by the state as an individual person in law, even if the person denies individual culpability (I followed instructions).
An individual person is accountable for their actions/decisions/instructions, subject to prosecution in both national and international law, from the time that they have reached age of majority , often though not always more or less coinciding with the granting of voting rights , tax and military duties / individual right to bear arms (protected only under certain constitutions).
In line with hierarchy , ultimate individual human reward for success and responsibility for failure is nonetheless found at the top of human society
A university ( Latin : universitas , 'a whole') is an institution of higher (or tertiary ) education and research which awards academic degrees in various academic disciplines .
Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education .
The word university is derived from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium , which roughly means community of teachers and scholars.
The modern university system has roots in the European medieval university , which was created in Italy and evolved from cathedral schools for the clergy during the High Middle Ages .
A bicycle , also called a cycle or bike , is a human-powered or motor-powered , pedal-driven , single-track vehicle , having two wheels attached to a frame , one behind the other.
A bicycle rider is called a cyclist , or bicyclist.
Bicycles were introduced in the late 19th century in Europe, and by the early 21st century, more than 1 billion were in existence at a given time.
These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of individual models produced.
They are the principal means of transportation in many regions.
They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys, general fitness , military and police applications, courier services , bicycle racing and bicycle stunts.
The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright or safety bicycle , has changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885.
However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design .
These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of cycling.
The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods.
Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings , pneumatic tires , chain-driven sprockets and tension-spoked wheels .
The watt (symbol: W ) is a unit of power .
In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer .
In dimensional analysis , power is described by M L 2 T − 3 {\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {M}}{\\mathsf {L}}^{2}{\\mathsf {T}}^{-3}} .
A boycott is an act of voluntary and intentional abstention from using, buying, or dealing with a person, organization, or country as an expression of protest, usually for moral, social , political , or environmental reasons.
The purpose of a boycott is to inflict some economic loss on the target, or to indicate a moral outrage, to try to compel the target to alter an objectionable behavior.
Sometimes, a boycott can be a form of consumer activism , sometimes called moral purchasing .
When a similar practice is legislated by a national government, it is known as a sanction .
A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle, such as a body of water , valley , or road , without closing the way underneath.
It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, usually something that can be detrimental to cross otherwise.
There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations.
Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it.
Most likely the earliest bridges were fallen trees and stepping stones , while Neolithic people built boardwalk bridges across marshland.
The Arkadiko Bridge dating from the 13th century BC, in the Peloponnese , in southern Greece is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use.
A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power .
It is composed of semiconductor material usually with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit.
A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals.
Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal.
Today, some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits .
Julius Edgar Lilienfeld patented a field-effect transistor in 1926, but it was not possible to actually construct a working device at that time.
The first practically implemented device was a point-contact transistor invented in 1947 by American physicists John Bardeen , Walter Brattain , and William Shockley .
Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievement.
The most widely used transistor is the MOSFET (metal–oxide–silicon field-effect transistor), also known as the MOS transistor, which was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959.
Transistors revolutionized the field of electronics, and paved the way for smaller and cheaper radios , calculators , and computers , among other things.
The first transistor and the MOSFET are on the list of IEEE milestones in electronics.
The MOS transistor is the fundamental building block of modern electronic devices , and is ubiquitous in modern electronic systems.
An estimated total of 13 sextillion MOS transistors have been manufactured as of 2018, making the MOSFET the most widely manufactured device in history.
Most transistors are made from very pure silicon , and some from germanium , but certain other semiconductor materials can also be used.
A transistor may have only one kind of charge carrier, in a field-effect transistor, or may have two kinds of charge carriers in bipolar junction transistor devices.
Compared with the vacuum tube , transistors are generally smaller, and require less power to operate.
Certain vacuum tubes have advantages over transistors at very high operating frequencies or high operating voltages.
Many types of transistors are made to standardized specifications by multiple manufacturers.
Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction.
Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions , although modern physicists usually consider it, with time , to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime .
The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe .
However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework .
Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the Timaeus of Plato , or Socrates in his reflections on what the Greeks called khôra (i.e. space), or in the Physics of Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of topos (i.e. place), or in the later geometrical conception of place as space qua extension in the Discourse on Place ( Qawl fi al-Makan ) of the 11th-century Arab polymath Alhazen .
Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the Renaissance and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly during the early development of classical mechanics .
In Isaac Newton 's view, space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in the space.
Other natural philosophers , notably Gottfried Leibniz , thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects, given by their distance and direction from one another.
In the 18th century, the philosopher and theologian George Berkeley attempted to refute the visibility of spatial depth in his Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision .
Later, the metaphysician Immanuel Kant said that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived from experiences of the outside world—they are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans possess and use to structure all experiences.
Kant referred to the experience of space in his Critique of Pure Reason as being a subjective pure a priori form of intuition.
In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean , in which space is conceived as curved , rather than flat .
According to Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity , space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space.
Experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.
A country is a region that is identified as a distinct entity in political geography .
A country may be an independent sovereign state or part of a larger state, as a non- sovereign or formerly sovereign political division , or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics.
Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.
There is no hard and fast definition of what regions are countries and which are not.
Countries can refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities, while other times it can refer only to states .
For example, the CIA World Factbook uses the word in its Country name field to refer to a wide variety of dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands , and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states.
Engineers , as practitioners of engineering , are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build, and test machines, systems, structures and materials to fulfill objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost.
The word engineer ( Latin ingeniator ) is derived from the Latin words ingeniare (to create, generate, contrive, devise) and ingenium (cleverness).
The foundational qualifications of an engineer typically include a four-year bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice (culminating in a project report or thesis) and passage of engineering board examinations.
The work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.
An artery (plural arteries ) (from Greek ἀρτηρία (artēria) , meaning 'windpipe, artery') is a blood vessel that takes blood away from the heart to all parts of the body (tissues, lungs, etc).
Most arteries carry oxygenated blood; the two exceptions are the pulmonary and the umbilical arteries , which carry deoxygenated blood to the organs that oxygenate it.
The effective arterial blood volume is that extracellular fluid which fills the arterial system.
The arteries are part of the circulatory system , which is responsible for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to all cells, as well as the removal of carbon dioxide and waste products, the maintenance of optimum blood pH , and the circulation of proteins and cells of the immune system .
Ownership is the state or fact of exclusive rights and control over property, which may be an object, land/real estate or intellectual property.
Ownership involves multiple rights, collectively referred to as title, which may be separated and held by different parties.
The process and mechanics of ownership are fairly complex: one can gain, transfer, and lose ownership of property in a number of ways.
To acquire property one can purchase it with money, trade it for other property, win it in a bet, receive it as a gift , inherit it, find it, receive it as damages , earn it by doing work or performing services, make it, or homestead it.
One can transfer or lose ownership of property by selling it for money , exchanging it for other property, giving it as a gift, misplacing it, or having it stripped from one's ownership through legal means such as eviction , foreclosure , seizure , or taking .
Ownership is self-propagating in that the owner of any property will also own the economic benefits of that property.
A bay is a recessed, coastal body of water that directly connects to a larger main body of water, such as an ocean , a lake , or another bay.
A large bay is usually called a gulf , sea , sound , or bight .
A cove is a type of smaller bay with a circular inlet and narrow entrance.
A fjord is a particularly steep bay shaped by glacial activity.
A bay can be the estuary of a river, such as the Chesapeake Bay , an estuary of the Susquehanna River .
Bays may also be nested within each other; for example, James Bay is an arm of Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada .
Some large bays, such as the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, have varied marine geology .
The land surrounding a bay often reduces the strength of winds and blocks waves .
Bays may have as wide a variety of shoreline characteristics as other shorelines.
In some cases, bays have beaches , which are usually characterized by a steep upper foreshore with a broad, flat fronting terrace.
Bays were significant in the history of human settlement because they provided safe places for fishing .
Later they were important in the development of sea trade as the safe anchorage they provide encouraged their selection as ports .
A door is a panel that covers an opening in a building, room or vehicle.
Doors are usually made of a hard, semi-permeable, and hard-to-break substance (such as wood or metal), but sometimes consisting of a hard frame into which windows or screens have been fitted.
Doors are often attached by hinges to a frame.
Doors make ingress into or egress from a building, room, or vehicle easier to manage.
The panel may be moved in various ways (at angles away from the frame, by sliding on a plane parallel to the frame, by folding in angles on a parallel plane, or by spinning along an axis at the center of the frame) to allow or prevent ingress or egress.
In most cases, a door's interior matches its exterior side.
But in other cases (e.g., a vehicle door ) the two sides are radically different.
Often doors have locking mechanisms to ensure that only some people can open them.
Doors can have devices such as knockers or doorbells by which people outside can announce their presence and summon someone either to open the door for them or give permission to open and enter.
Apart from providing access into and out of a space, doors can have the secondary functions of ensuring privacy by preventing unwanted attention from outsiders, of separating areas with different functions, of allowing light to pass into and out of a space, of controlling ventilation or air drafts so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled, of dampening noise , and of blocking the spread of fire .
Doors may have aesthetic , symbolic , ritualistic purposes.
To be given the key to a door can signify a change in status from outsider to insider.
Doors and doorways frequently appear in literature and the arts with metaphorical or allegorical import as a portent of change.
In monotheistic thought, God is conceived of as the supreme being, creator deity , and principal object of faith .
God is usually conceived as being omniscient (all-knowing), omnipotent (all-powerful), omnipresent (all-present) and as having an eternal and necessary existence.
These attributes are used either in way of analogy or are taken literally.
God is most often held to be incorporeal (immaterial).
Incorporeality and corporeality of God are related to conceptions of transcendence (being outside nature) and immanence (being in nature) of God, with positions of synthesis such as the immanent transcendence .
Some religions describe God without reference to gender, while others or their translations use sex-specific terminology.
Judaism , for example, attributes only a grammatical gender to God , using terms such as Him or Father for convenience.
God has been conceived as either personal or impersonal.
In theism , God is the creator and sustainer of the universe , while in deism , God is the creator, but not the sustainer, of the universe.
In pantheism , God is the universe itself.
In atheism , there is an absence of belief in God.
In agnosticism , the existence of God is deemed unknown or unknowable.
God has also been conceived as the source of all moral obligation , and the greatest conceivable existent.
Many notable philosophers have developed arguments for and against the existence of God .
Monotheists refer to their gods using names prescribed by their respective religions, with some of these names referring to certain cultural ideas about their god's identity and attributes.
In the ancient Egyptian era of Atenism , possibly the earliest recorded monotheistic religion, this deity was called Aten , premised on being the one true Supreme Being and creator of the universe.
In the Hebrew Bible and Judaism , Elohim , Adonai , YHWH ( Hebrew : יהוה ‎) and other names are used as the names of God.
Yahweh and Jehovah , possible vocalizations of YHWH, are used in Christianity.
In the Christian doctrine of the Trinity , God, coexisting in three persons, is called the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit .
In Islam , the name Allah is used, while Muslims also have a multitude of titular names for God.
In Hinduism , Brahman is often considered a monistic concept of God.
In Chinese religion , Shangdi is conceived as the progenitor (first ancestor) of the universe, intrinsic to it and constantly bringing order to it.
Other religions have names for the concept, for instance, Baha in the Bahá'í Faith , Waheguru in Sikhism , Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa in Balinese Hinduism , and Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism .
The many different conceptions of God, and competing claims as to God's characteristics, aims, and actions, have led to the development of ideas of omnitheism , pandeism , or a perennial philosophy , which postulates that there is one underlying theological truth, of which all religions express a partial understanding, and as to which the devout in the various great world religions are in fact worshipping that one God, but through different, overlapping concepts.

Dictionaries traditionally define literacy as the ability to read and write .
In the modern world, this is one way of interpreting literacy.
One more broad interpretation sees literacy as knowledge and competence in a specific area.
The concept of literacy has evolved in meaning.
The modern term's meaning has been expanded to include the ability to use language, numbers, images, computers, and other basic means to understand, communicate, gain useful knowledge, solve mathematical problems and use the dominant symbol systems of a culture.
The concept of literacy is expanding across OECD countries to include skills to access knowledge through technology and ability to assess complex contexts.
A person who travels and resides in a foreign country but is unable to read or write in the language of the host country would be regarded by the locals as illiterate.
The key to literacy is reading development, a progression of skills which begins with the ability to understand spoken words and decode written words, and which culminates in the deep understanding of text.
Reading development involves a range of complex language-underpinnings including awareness of speech sounds ( phonology ), spelling patterns ( orthography ), word meaning ( semantics ), grammar ( syntax ) and patterns of word formation ( morphology ), all of which provide a necessary platform for reading fluency and comprehension.
Once these skills are acquired, a reader can attain full language literacy, which includes the abilities to apply to printed material critical analysis, inference and synthesis; to write with accuracy and coherence; and to use information and insights from text as the basis for informed decisions and creative thought.
The inability to do so is called illiteracy or analphabetism.
Experts at a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) meeting have proposed defining literacy as the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute, using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts.
The experts note: Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in their community and wider society.
Institutions , according to Samuel P.
Huntington, are stable, valued, recurring patterns of behavior.
Further, institutions can refer to mechanisms of social order , which govern the behaviour of a set of individuals within a given community.
Moreover, institutions are identified with a social purpose , transcending individuals and intentions by mediating the rules that govern living behavior.
According to Geoffrey M.
Hodgson, it is misleading to say that an institution is a form of behavior.
Instead, Hodgson states that institution are “integrated systems of rules that structure social interactions”.
The term institution commonly applies to both informal institutions such as customs, or behavior patterns important to a society , and to particular formal institutions created by entities such as the government and public services.
Primary or meta-institutions are institutions such as the family that are broad enough to encompass other institutions.
Institutions are a principal object of study in social sciences such as political science , anthropology , economics , and sociology (the latter described by Émile Durkheim as the science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning).
Institutions are also a central concern for law , the formal mechanism for political rule-making and enforcement.
The workforce or labour force is the labour pool in employment .
It is generally used to describe those working for a single company or industry , but can also apply to a geographic region like a city, state, or country.
Within a company, its value can be labelled as its Workforce in Place.
The workforce of a country includes both the employed and the unemployed.
The labour force participation rate , LFPR (or economic activity rate , EAR ), is the ratio between the labour force and the overall size of their cohort (national population of the same age range).
The term generally excludes the employers or management , and can imply those involved in manual labour .
It may also mean all those who are available for work.
Borders Group, Inc.
(former NYSE ticker symbol BGP ) was an international book and music retailer based in Ann Arbor, Michigan .
In its final year, the company employed about 19,500 people throughout the U.S., primarily in its Borders and Waldenbooks stores.
At the beginning of 2010, the company operated 511 Borders superstores in the US.
The company also operated 175 stores in the Waldenbooks Specialty Retail segment, including Waldenbooks , Borders Express, Borders airport stores, and Borders Outlet stores.
In February 2011, Borders applied for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and began liquidating 226 of its stores in the United States.
Despite a purchase offer from the private-equity firm Najafi Companies, Borders was not able to find a buyer acceptable to its creditors before its July bidding deadline, so it began liquidating its remaining 399 retail outlets, with the last remaining stores closing their doors in September.
The Chapter 11 case was ultimately converted to Chapter 7 .
Rival bookseller Barnes & Noble acquired Borders' trademarks and customer list.
By the end of December 2010, Borders employed an estimated 1,150 across its U.K. stores, which went into bankruptcy administration before the end of 2010.
All stores were closed by December 31, 2010.
Borders Group also formerly operated stores in Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.
However, these were sold off to Pacific Equity Partners (which owned rival Angus & Robertson ) in 2008, then were later sold again to REDgroup Retail .
The stores continued to operate under the Borders brand as the unaffiliated Borders Asia Pacific until RedGroup was placed into voluntary administration in February 2011; with the five New Zealand stores sold to the James Pascoe Group and the Australian stores gradually shut down, with the last group closing in July 2011.
A warrior is a person specializing in combat or warfare , especially within the context of a tribal or clan -based warrior culture society that recognizes a separate warrior class or caste .
Kea ( Greek : Κέα ), also known as Tzia ( Greek : Τζια ) and in antiquity Keos ( Greek : Κέως , Latin : Ceos ), is a Greek island in the Cyclades archipelago in the Aegean Sea .
Kea is part of the Kea-Kythnos regional unit.
A monk ( , from Greek : μοναχός , monachos , single, solitary via Latin monachus ) is a person who practices religious asceticism by monastic living, either alone or with any number of other monks.
A monk may be a person who decides to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings, or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live his or her life in prayer and contemplation.
The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy.
In the Greek language the term can apply to women, but in modern English it is mainly in use for men.
The word nun is typically used for female monastics.
Although the term monachos is of Christian origin, in the English language monk tends to be used loosely also for both male and female ascetics from other religious or philosophical backgrounds.
However, being generic, it is not interchangeable with terms that denote particular kinds of monk, such as cenobite , hermit , anchorite , hesychast , or solitary.
Tokyo ( 東京 , Tōkyō , English: , Japanese: toːkʲoː ( listen ) ; lit.
Eastern Capital) , officially Tokyo Metropolis ( 東京都 , Tōkyō-to ) , one of the 47 prefectures of Japan , has served as the Japanese capital since 1869.
As of 2018 , the Greater Tokyo Area ranked as the most populous metropolitan area in the world.
The urban area houses the seat of the Emperor of Japan , of the Japanese government and of the National Diet .
Tokyo forms part of the Kantō region on the southeastern side of Japan's main island, Honshu , and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands .
Tokyo was formerly named Edo when Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters in 1603.
It became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo.
The Tokyo Metropolis formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture ( 東京府 , Tōkyō-fu ) and the city of Tokyo ( 東京市 , Tōkyō-shi ) .
Tokyo is often referred to as a city but is officially known and governed as a metropolitan prefecture, which differs from and combines elements of a city and a prefecture, a characteristic unique to Tokyo.
The 23 Special Wards of Tokyo were formerly Tokyo City .
On July 1, 1943, it merged with Tokyo Prefecture and became Tokyo Metropolis with an additional 26 municipalities in the western part of the prefecture, and the Izu islands and Ogasawara islands south of Tokyo.
As of October 1, 2015, the population of Tokyo is estimated to be over 13.4 million, or about 11% of Japan's total population.
The latest estimate in 2019 shows the growing population of Tokyo with 13.9 million people, with the special wards 9.6 million, the Tama area 4.2 million, and the Islands 25,147.
The prefecture is part of the world's most populous metropolitan area called the Greater Tokyo Area with over 38 million people and the world's largest urban agglomeration economy .
As of 2011 , Tokyo hosted 51 of the Fortune Global 500 companies, the highest number of any city in the world at that time.
Tokyo ranked third (twice) in the International Financial Centres Development Index .
The city is home to various television networks such as Fuji TV , Tokyo MX , TV Tokyo , TV Asahi , Nippon Television , NHK and the Tokyo Broadcasting System .
Tokyo ranks first in the Global Economic Power Index and third in the Global Cities Index .
The GaWC 's 2018 inventory classified Tokyo as an alpha+ world city – and as of 2014 TripAdvisor 's World City Survey ranked Tokyo first in its Best overall experience category (the city also ranked first in the following categories: helpfulness of locals, nightlife, shopping, local public transportation and cleanliness of streets).
As of 2018 Tokyo ranked as the 2nd- most expensive city for expatriates, according to the Mercer consulting firm.
and also the world's 11th-most expensive city according to the Economist Intelligence Unit 's cost-of-living survey.
In 2015, Tokyo was named the Most Liveable City in the world by the magazine Monocle .
The Michelin Guide has awarded Tokyo by far the most Michelin stars of any city in the world.
Tokyo was ranked first out of all sixty cities in the 2017 Safe Cities Index.
The QS Best Student Cities ranked Tokyo as the 3rd-best city in the world to be a university student in 2016 and 2nd in 2018.
Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics , the 1979 G-7 summit , the 1986 G-7 summit , and the 1993 G-7 summit , and will host the 2019 Rugby World Cup , the 2020 Summer Olympics and the 2020 Summer Paralympics .
Performance is completion of a task with application of knowledge, skills and abilities.

Layar is a Dutch company based in Amsterdam , founded in 2009 by Raimo van der Klein, Claire Boonstra and Maarten Lens-FitzGerald.
They have created a mobile browser called Layar .
The browser allows users to find various items based upon augmented reality technology.
On September 1, 2010, the World Economic Forum announced the company as a Technology Pioneer for 2011.
In June 2014 Layar was acquired by the UK company Blippar .
The Layar office in Amsterdam was closed down in 2016.
Management (or managing ) is the administration of an organization , whether it is a business , a not-for-profit organization, or government body.
Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees (or of volunteers) to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources , such as financial , natural , technological , and human resources .
The term management may also refer to those people who manage an organization.
Social scientists study management as an academic discipline , investigating areas such as social organization and organizational leadership .
Some people study management at colleges or universities; major degrees in management include the Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.) Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA.) Master of Business Administration (MBA.) and, for the public sector, the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree.
Individuals who aim to become management specialists or experts, management researchers, or professors may complete the Doctor of Management (DM), the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), or the PhD in Business Administration or Management.
There has recently been a movement for evidence-based management .
Larger organizations generally have three levels of managers, which are typically organized in a hierarchical , pyramid structure:
In smaller organizations, an individual manager may have a much wider scope.
A single manager may perform several roles or even all of the roles commonly observed in a large organization.
A flower , sometimes known as a bloom or blossom , is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta , also called angiosperms).
The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs.
Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower).
Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization ( parthenocarpy ).
Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop.
Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen .
After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds .
In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion , medicine and as a source of food.
Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons , falling after spring and before autumn .
At the summer solstice , the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.
The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate , tradition, and culture.
When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere , it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere , and vice versa.
Color ( American English ), or colour ( Commonwealth English ), is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color categories , with names such as red , orange , yellow , green , blue , or purple .
This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum .
Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them.
This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc.
By defining a color space , colors can be identified numerically by coordinates, which in 1931 were also named in global agreement with internationally agreed color names like mentioned above (red, orange, etc.) by the International Commission on Illumination .
The RGB color space for instance is a color space corresponding to human trichromacy and to the three cone cell types that respond to three bands of light: long wavelengths, peaking near 564–580 nm ( red ); medium-wavelength, peaking near 534–545 nm ( green ); and short-wavelength light, near 420–440 nm ( blue ).
There may also be more than three color dimensions in other color spaces, such as in the CMYK color model , wherein one of the dimensions relates to a color's colorfulness ).
The photo-receptivity of the eyes of other species also varies considerably from that of humans and so results in correspondingly different color perceptions that cannot readily be compared to one another.
Honeybees and bumblebees for instance have trichromatic color vision sensitive to ultraviolet but is insensitive to red.
Papilio butterflies possess six types of photoreceptors and may have pentachromatic vision.
The most complex color vision system in the animal kingdom has been found in stomatopods (such as the mantis shrimp ) with up to 12 spectral receptor types thought to work as multiple dichromatic units.
The science of color is sometimes called chromatics , colorimetry , or simply color science .
It includes the study of the perception of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, color theory in art , and the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range (that is, what is commonly referred to simply as light ).
A surface , as the term is most generally used, is the outermost or uppermost layer of a physical object or space.
It is the portion or region of the object that can first be perceived by an observer using the senses of sight and touch, and is the portion with which other materials first interact.
The surface of an object is more than a mere geometric solid, but is filled with, spread over by, or suffused with perceivable qualities such as color and warmth.
The concept of surface has been abstracted and formalized in mathematics , specifically in geometry .
Depending on the properties on which the emphasis is given, there are several non equivalent such formalizations, that are all called surface , sometimes with some qualifier, such as algebraic surface , smooth surface or fractal surface .
The concept of surface and its mathematical abstraction are both widely used in physics , engineering , computer graphics , and many other disciplines, primarily in representing the surfaces of physical objects.
For example, in analyzing the aerodynamic properties of an airplane , the central consideration is the flow of air along its surface.
The concept also raises certain philosophical questions—for example, how thick is the layer of atoms or molecules that can be considered part of the surface of an object (i.e., where does the surface end and the interior begin), and do objects really have a surface at all if, at the subatomic level, they never actually come in contact with other objects.
An invention is a unique or novel device , method, composition or process.
The invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process.
It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result.
An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough.
Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field .
An inventor may be taking a big step toward success or failure.
Some inventions can be patented.
A patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention.
The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary by country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.
Another meaning of invention is cultural invention , which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others.
The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books.
Invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity .
Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability.

Mechanics ( Greek μηχανική ) is the area of science concerned with the behaviour of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements , and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment.The scientific discipline has its origins in Ancient Greece with the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes (see History of classical mechanics and Timeline of classical mechanics ).
During the early modern period , scientists such as Galileo , Kepler , and Newton laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics .It is a branch of classical physics that deals with particles that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light.
It can also be defined as a branch of science which deals with the motion of and forces on objects.
The field is yet less widely understood in terms of quantum theory.

The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals.
The brain is located in the head , usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision .
The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body.
In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14–16 billion neurons , and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion.
Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons.
These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons , which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.
Physiologically , the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body.
The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones .
This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment .
Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia , but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.
The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved.
Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways.
This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates.
It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains.
The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article.
Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context.
The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage, that are covered in the human brain article.
Prohibition is the act or practice of forbidding something by law; more particularly the term refers to the banning of the manufacture , storage (whether in barrels or in bottles ), transportation , sale, possession, and consumption of alcoholic beverages .
The word is also used to refer to a period of time during which such bans are enforced.
In physics , a fluid is a substance that continually deforms (flows) under an applied shear stress , or external force.
Fluids are a phase of matter and include liquids , gases and plasmas .
They are substances with zero shear modulus , or, in simpler terms, substances which cannot resist any shear force applied to them.
Although the term fluid includes both the liquid and gas phases, in common usage, fluid is often used as a synonym for liquid, with no implication that gas could also be present.
This colloquial usage of the term is also common in medicine and in nutrition (take plenty of fluids).
Liquids form a free surface (that is, a surface not created by the container) while gases do not.
Viscoelastic fluids like Silly Putty appear to behave similar to a solid when a sudden force is applied.
Also substances with a very high viscosity such as pitch appear to behave like a solid (see pitch drop experiment ).
Leadership is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or organization to lead or guide other individuals, teams , or entire organizations .
Specialist literature debates various viewpoints, contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) United States versus European approaches.
U.S. academic environments define leadership as a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task .
Studies of leadership have produced theories involving traits , situational interaction, function, behavior, power , vision and values , charisma , and intelligence, among others.
Eyes are organs of the visual system .
They provide animals with vision , the ability to receive and process visual detail, as well as enabling several photo response functions that are independent of vision.
Eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons .
In higher organisms, the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm , focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals, and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain.
Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system.
Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs , chordates and arthropods .
The simplest eyes, such as those in microorganisms , do nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark , which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms .
From more complex eyes, retinal photosensitive ganglion cells send signals along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to effect circadian adjustment and to the pretectal area to control the pupillary light reflex .
A camera is an optical instrument to capture still images or to record moving images , which are stored in a physical medium such as in a digital system or on photographic film .
A camera consists of a lens which focuses light from the scene, and a camera body which holds the image capture mechanism.
The still image camera is the main instrument in the art of photography and captured images may be reproduced later as a part of the process of photography, digital imaging , photographic printing .
The similar artistic fields in the moving image camera domain are film , videography , and cinematography .
The word camera comes from camera obscura , which means dark chamber and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external reality onto a flat surface.
The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura.
The functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of the human eye.
The first permanent photograph was made in 1825 by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce .
An image (from Latin : imago ) is an artifact that depicts visual perception , such as a photograph or other two-dimensional picture , that resembles a subject—usually a physical object —and thus provides a depiction of it.
In the context of signal processing , an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s).
A person is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as reason , morality , consciousness or self-consciousness , and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as kinship , ownership of property , or legal responsibility .
The defining features of personhood and consequently what makes a person count as a person differ widely among cultures and contexts.
In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about personal identity and self : both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.
The common plural of person, people , is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in a people).
The plural persons is often used in philosophical and legal writing.
A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis.
Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flat screen television, and en-suite bathrooms .
Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities.
Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers, and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function services.
Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs ) to allow guests to identify their room.
Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms.
Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement.
In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours.
In Japan , capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.
The precursor to the modern hotel was the inn of medieval Europe .
For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, coaching inns served as a place for lodging for coach travelers.
Inns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century.
One of the first hotels in a modern sense was opened in Exeter in 1768.
Hotels proliferated throughout Western Europe and North America in the early 19th century, and luxury hotels began to spring up in the later part of the 19th century.
Hotel operations vary in size, function, complexity, and cost.
Most hotels and major hospitality companies have set industry standards to classify hotel types.
An upscale full-service hotel facility offers luxury amenities, full service accommodations, an on-site restaurant , and the highest level of personalized service, such as a concierge , room service , and clothes pressing staff.
Full service hotels often contain upscale full-service facilities with a large number of full service accommodations, an on-site full service restaurant , and a variety of on-site amenities .
Boutique hotels are smaller independent, non-branded hotels that often contain upscale facilities.
Small to medium-sized hotel establishments offer a limited amount of on-site amenities .
Economy hotels are small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer basic accommodations with little to no services.
Extended stay hotels are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer-term full service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel.
Timeshare and destination clubs are a form of property ownership involving ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage.
A motel is a small-sized low-rise lodging with direct access to individual rooms from the car park.
Boutique hotels are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting.
A number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture, such as the Ritz Hotel in London .
Some hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself, for example at casinos and holiday resorts .
Most hotel establishments are run by a General Manager who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the Hotel Manager ), department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel (e.g., food service), middle managers , administrative staff, and line-level supervisors.
The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function and class, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.
A photograph (also known as a photo ) is an image created by light falling on a photosensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic image sensor , such as a CCD or a CMOS chip.
Most photographs are created using a camera , which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see.
The process and practice of creating such images is called photography .
The word photograph was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek φῶς ( phos ), meaning light, and γραφή ( graphê ), meaning drawing, writing, together meaning drawing with light.
In computer programming , a subroutine is a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit.
This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed.
Subprograms may be defined within programs, or separately in libraries that can be used by many programs.
In different programming languages, a subroutine may be called a procedure , a function , a routine , a method , or a subprogram .
The generic term callable unit is sometimes used.
The name subprogram suggests a subroutine behaves in much the same way as a computer program that is used as one step in a larger program or another subprogram.
A subroutine is often coded so that it can be started several times and from several places during one execution of the program, including from other subroutines, and then branch back ( return ) to the next instruction after the call , once the subroutine's task is done.
The idea of a subroutine was initially conceived by John Mauchly during his work on ENIAC , and recorded in a Harvard symposium in January of 1947 entitled 'Preparation of Problems for EDVAC-type Machines'.
Maurice Wilkes , David Wheeler , and Stanley Gill are generally credited with the formal invention of this concept, which they termed a closed subroutine , contrasted with an open subroutine or macro .
Subroutines are a powerful programming tool, and the syntax of many programming languages includes support for writing and using them.
Judicious use of subroutines (for example, through the structured programming approach) will often substantially reduce the cost of developing and maintaining a large program, while increasing its quality and reliability.
Subroutines, often collected into libraries , are an important mechanism for sharing and trading software.
The discipline of object-oriented programming is based on objects and methods (which are subroutines attached to these objects or object classes ).
In the compiling method called threaded code , the executable program is basically a sequence of subroutine calls.
A theory is a contemplative and rational type of abstract or generalizing thinking about a phenomenon , or the results of such thinking.
The process of contemplative and rational thinking often is associated with such processes like observational study , research .
Theories may either be scientific or other than scientific (or scientific to less extent).
Depending on the context, the results might, for example, include generalized explanations of how nature works.
The word has its roots in ancient Greek , but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings.
In modern science , the term theory refers to scientific theories , a well-confirmed type of explanation of nature , made in a way consistent with scientific method , and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science .
Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide empirical support for, or empirically contradict ( falsify ) it.
Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, in contrast to more common uses of the word theory that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word hypothesis ).
Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable conjectures , and from scientific laws , which are descriptive accounts of the way nature behaves under certain conditions.
Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values.
A theory can be a body of knowledge , which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory models .
To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge.
The word theory or in theory is more or less often used erroneously by people to explain something which they individually did not experience or tested before.
In those instances, semantically, it is being replaced for another concept , a hypothesis .
Instead of using the word hypothetically, it is exchanged for a phrase in theory.
In some instances the theory's credibility could be contested by calling it just a theory (implying that the idea has not even been tested).
Hence, that word theory is very often contrasted to practice (from Greek praxis , πρᾶξις) a Greek term for doing , which is opposed to theory.
A classical example of the distinction between theoretical and practical uses the discipline of medicine: medical theory involves trying to understand the causes and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy.
These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked.
In reality, there is a long and a thorny process for an idea or hypothesis to become a theory.
And even after it becomes one, it is constantly being tested for validity.
Among notable and long discussed theories are Darwinism (or other related to Creation–evolution controversy ), flat Earth and others.
Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals .
They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea , usually excluding dolphins and porpoises .
Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla , which consists of even-toed ungulates .
Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses , having diverged about 40 million years ago.
The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago.
Whales consist of eight extant families : Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).
Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea.
So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land.
Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale , which is the largest creature that has ever lived.
The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth.
Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism , in that the females are larger than males.
Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on.
They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water.
Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water.
Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid .
Baleen whales have a well developed sense of smell, whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind.
Some species, such as sperm whales, are well adapted for diving to great depths to catch squid and other favoured prey.
Whales have evolved from land-living mammals.
As such, whales must breathe air regularly, although they can remain submerged under water for long periods of time.
Some species such as the sperm whale are able to stay submerged for as much as 90 minutes.
They have blowholes (modified nostrils) located on top of their heads, through which air is taken in and expelled.
They are warm-blooded , and have a layer of fat, or blubber , under the skin.
With streamlined fusiform bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers, whales can travel at up to 20 knots , though they are not as flexible or agile as seals .
Whales produce a great variety of vocalizations, notably the extended songs of the humpback whale .
Although whales are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth.
Species such as humpbacks and blue whales are capable of travelling thousands of miles without feeding.
Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years.
Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them.
Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for one to two years.
Once relentlessly hunted for their products, whales are now protected by international law.
The North Atlantic right whales nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and the North Pacific grey whale population is ranked Critically Endangered by the IUCN .
Besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution.
The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic.
Whales have been depicted in various cultures worldwide, notably by the Inuit and the coastal peoples of Vietnam and Ghana, who sometimes hold whale funerals.
Whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale of Herman Melville 's Moby Dick .
Small whales, such as belugas , are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor and the animals often die within a few months of capture.
Whale watching has become a form of tourism around the world.
An image (from Latin : imago ) is an artifact that depicts visual perception , such as a photograph or other two-dimensional picture , that resembles a subject—usually a physical object —and thus provides a depiction of it.
In the context of signal processing , an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s).
A province is almost always an administrative division within a country or state .
The term derives from the ancient Roman provincia , which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy .
The term province has since been adopted by many countries.
In some countries with no actual provinces, the provinces is a metaphorical term meaning outside the capital city .
While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers , others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities.
Many have their own powers independent of central or federal authority, especially in Canada .
In other countries, like China or France , provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy.
Extreme may refer to:
A lecture (from the French lecture , meaning reading ) is an oral presentation intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a university or college teacher .
Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations.
A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a businessman's sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture.
Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content.
Though lectures are much criticised as a teaching method , universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses.
Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of communication that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon passive learning .
Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to active learning .
Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in academia as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study.
Lectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well.
Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on keynote addresses , i.e., lectures.
The public lecture has a long history in the sciences and in social movements .
Union halls , for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters.
Similarly, churches , community centers , libraries , museums , and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests.
Lectures represent a continuation of oral tradition in contrast to textual communication in books and other media.
Lectures may be considered a type of grey literature .
Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts , such as taxes , in a particular country or socio-economic context.
The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange , a unit of account , a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment .
Any item or verifiable record that fulfils these functions can be considered as money.
Money is historically an emergent market phenomenon establishing a commodity money , but nearly all contemporary money systems are based on fiat money .
Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without use value as a physical commodity.
It derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender ; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for all debts, public and private.
Counterfeit money can cause good money to lose its value.
The money supply of a country consists of currency ( banknotes and coins ) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts , savings accounts , and other types of bank accounts ).
Bank money, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries.
Bacteria ( ( listen ) ; common noun bacteria , singular bacterium ) are a type of biological cell .
They constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms .
Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes , ranging from spheres to rods and spirals .
Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth , and are present in most of its habitats .
Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs , radioactive waste , and the deep portions of Earth's crust .
Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals.
Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory (specifically unculturable phyla, known as candidate phyla, make up 103 out of approximately 142 known phyla).
The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology , a branch of microbiology .
Virtually all animal life on earth is dependent on bacteria for their survival as only bacteria and some archea possess the genes and enzymes necessary to synthesize vitamin B 12 , also known as cobalamin , and provide it through the food chain.
Vitamin B 12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body.
It is a cofactor in DNA synthesis , and in both fatty acid and amino acid metabolism , It is particularly important in the normal functioning of the nervous system via its role in the synthesis of myelin .
There are typically 40 million bacterial cells in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water .
There are approximately 5×10 bacteria on Earth, forming a biomass which exceeds that of all plants and animals.
Bacteria are vital in many stages of the nutrient cycle by recycling nutrients such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere .
The nutrient cycle includes the decomposition of dead bodies ; bacteria are responsible for the putrefaction stage in this process.
In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps , extremophile bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane , to energy.
Data reported by researchers in October 2012 and published in March 2013 suggested that bacteria thrive in the Mariana Trench , which, with a depth of up to 11 kilometres, is the deepest known part of the oceans .
Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 580 metres below the sea floor under 2.6 kilometres of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States.
According to one of the researchers, You can find microbes everywhere—they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are.
The famous notion that bacterial cells in the human body outnumber human cells by a factor of 10:1 has been debunked.
There are approximately 39 trillion bacterial cells in the human microbiota as personified by a reference 70 kg male 170 cm tall, whereas there are 30 trillion human cells in the body.
This means that although they do have the upper hand in actual numbers, it is only by 30%, and not 900%.
The largest number exist in the gut flora , and a large number on the skin .
The vast majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system , though many are beneficial , particularly in the gut flora.
However, several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases , including cholera , syphilis , anthrax , leprosy , and bubonic plague .
The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections , with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa .
In developed countries , antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem.
In industry, bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills , the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation , the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology , and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.
Once regarded as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes , bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes .
Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes , bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles .
Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes, the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor .
These evolutionary domains are called Bacteria and Archaea .
Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other things, including bridges, roads, vehicles, and buildings.
The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering , each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics , applied science , and types of application.
See glossary of engineering .
The term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium , meaning cleverness and ingeniare , meaning to contrive, devise.
Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid , liquid , and plasma ).
A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon ), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen ), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide ).
A gas mixture , such as air , contains a variety of pure gases.
What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles.
This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer.
The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible, as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image.
The gaseous state of matter occurs between the liquid and plasma states, the latter of which provides the upper temperature boundary for gases.
Bounding the lower end of the temperature scale lie degenerative quantum gases which are gaining increasing attention.
High-density atomic gases super-cooled to very low temperatures are classified by their statistical behavior as either Bose gases or Fermi gases .
For a comprehensive listing of these exotic states of matter see list of states of matter .
In chemistry , a mixture is a material made up of two or more different substances which are physically combined.
A mixture is the physical combination of two or more substances in which the identities are retained and are mixed in the form of solutions , suspension and colloids .
Mixtures are one product of mechanically blending or mixing chemical substances such as elements and compounds , without chemical bonding or other chemical change, so that each ingredient substance retains its own chemical properties and makeup.
Despite the fact that there are no chemical changes to its constituents, the physical properties of a mixture, such as its melting point , may differ from those of the components.
Some mixtures can be separated into their components by using physical (mechanical or thermal) means.
Azeotropes are one kind of mixture that usually poses considerable difficulties regarding the separation processes required to obtain their constituents (physical or chemical processes or, even a blend of them).
A century is a period of 100 years .
Centuries are numbered ordinally in English and many other languages.
The word century comes from the Latin centum , meaning one hundred .
Century is sometimes abbreviated as c.
A centenary is a hundredth anniversary, or a celebration of this, typically the remembrance of an event which took place a hundred years earlier.
A town is a human settlement .
Towns are generally larger than villages but smaller than cities , though the criteria to distinguish them vary considerably between different parts of the world.

Fisher is an archaic term for a fisherman , revived as gender-neutral.
Fisher , Fishers or The Fisher may also refer to:
A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways , carrying passengers or goods, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research and fishing.
Historically, a ship was a sailing vessel with at least three square-rigged masts and a full bowsprit .
Ships are generally distinguished from boats , based on size, shape, load capacity, and tradition.
Ships have been important contributors to human migration and commerce.
They have supported the spread of colonization and the slave trade , but have also served scientific, cultural, and humanitarian needs.
After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to the world population growth .
Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.
As of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships , totaling almost 1.8 billion dead weight tons .
Of these 28% were oil tankers , 43% were bulk carriers , and 13% were container ships .
Well-being , wellbeing , or wellness is the condition of an individual or group.
A high level of well-being means that in some sense the individual's or group's condition is positive.

Yosemite National Park ( yoh- SEM -i-tee ) is an American national park located in the western Sierra Nevada of Central California , bounded on the southeast by Sierra National Forest and on the northwest by Stanislaus National Forest .
The park is managed by the National Park Service and covers an area of 748,436 acres (1,169 sq mi; 3,029 km ) and sits in four counties : centered in Tuolumne and Mariposa , extending north and east to Mono and south to Madera County .
Designated a World Heritage site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves, lakes, mountains, meadows, glaciers, and biological diversity .
Almost 95% of the park is designated wilderness .
On average, about 4 million people visit Yosemite each year, and most spend the majority of their time in the 7 square miles (18 km ) of Yosemite Valley .
The park set a visitation record in 2016, surpassing 5 million visitors for the first time in its history.
Yosemite was central to the development of the national park idea.
Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln 's signing the Yosemite Grant in 1864.
John Muir led a successful movement to have Congress establish a larger national park by 1890, one which encompassed the valley and its surrounding mountains and forests, paving the way for the National Park System .
Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada, and the park supports a diversity of plants and animals.
The park has an elevation range from 2,127 to 13,114 feet (648 to 3,997 m) and contains five major vegetation zones : chaparral and oak woodland, lower montane forest , upper montane forest , subalpine zone , and alpine .
Of California's 7,000 plant species, about 50% occur in the Sierra Nevada and more than 20% are within Yosemite.
The park contains suitable habitat for more than 160 rare plants, with rare local geologic formations and unique soils characterizing the restricted ranges many of these plants occupy.
The geology of the Yosemite area is characterized by granitic rocks and remnants of older rock.
About 10 million years ago, the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and then tilted to form its relatively gentle western slopes and the more dramatic eastern slopes.
The uplift increased the steepness of stream and river beds, resulting in the formation of deep, narrow canyons.
About one million years ago, snow and ice accumulated, forming glaciers at the higher alpine meadows that moved down the river valleys.
Ice thickness in Yosemite Valley may have reached 4,000 feet (1,200 m) during the early glacial episode.
The downslope movement of the ice masses cut and sculpted the U-shaped valley that attracts so many visitors to its scenic vistas today.
The name Yosemite (meaning killer in Miwok ) originally referred to the name of a renegade tribe which was driven out of the area (and possibly annihilated) by the Mariposa Battalion .
Previously, the area had been called Ahwahnee (big mouth) by indigenous people.
A brick is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction.
Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay , but it is now used to denote rectangular units made of clay-bearing soil, sand, and lime , or concrete materials.
Bricks can be joined together using mortar , adhesives or by interlocking them.
Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities.
Two basic categories of bricks are fired and non-fired bricks.
Block is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials, but is usually larger than a brick.
Lightweight bricks (also called lightweight blocks) are made from expanded clay aggregate .
Fired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest building materials , sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since circa 4000 BC.
Air-dried bricks, also known as mudbricks , have a history older than fired bricks, and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw.
Bricks are laid in courses and numerous patterns known as bonds , collectively known as brickwork , and may be laid in various kinds of mortar to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure.
A dissident , broadly defined, is a person who actively challenges an established doctrine, policy, or institution.
In a religious context, the word has been used since 18th century, and in the political sense since 1940, coinciding with the rise of totalitarian systems, especially the Soviet Union , Nazi Germany and Saudi Arabia .
Nursing is a profession within the health care sector focused on the care of individuals, families, and communities so they may attain, maintain, or recover optimal health and quality of life .
Nurses may be differentiated from other health care providers by their approach to patient care , training , and scope of practice .
Nurses practice in many specialties with differing levels of prescription authority .
Many nurses provide care within the ordering scope of physicians , and this traditional role has shaped the public image of nurses as care providers.
However, nurse practitioners are permitted by most jurisdictions to practice independently in a variety of settings.
Since the postwar period, nurse education has undergone a process of diversification towards advanced and specialized credentials , and many of the traditional regulations and provider roles are changing.
Nurses develop a plan of care, working collaboratively with physicians, therapists, the patient, the patient's family and other team members, that focuses on treating illness to improve quality of life.
In the United States and the United Kingdom, advanced practice nurses, such as clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners, diagnose health problems and prescribe medications and other therapies, depending on individual state regulations.
Nurses may help coordinate the patient care performed by other members of a multidisciplinary health care team such as therapists, medical practitioners and dietitians.
Nurses provide care both interdependently, for example, with physicians, and independently as nursing professionals.
An antibody ( Ab ), also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ), is a large, Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses .
The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen, called an antigen , via the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) variable region.
Each tip of the Y of an antibody contains a paratope (analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly, analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision.
Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by inhibiting a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival).
Depending on the antigen, the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance.
The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region (located at the base of the Y), which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions.
The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system .
Antibodies are secreted by B cells of the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells .
Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma , and a membrane -bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B-cell receptor (BCR).
The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure.
In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding.
Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.
Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily .
They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins .
They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains .
There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may be attached to the antigen-binding fragments.
The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes .
Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds.
The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region.
The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter.
For example, IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release.
IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen , for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε.
The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.
Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist.
This region is known as the hypervariable region .
Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen.
This enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens.
The large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen-binding sites (or paratopes ), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity.
This recombinational process that produces clonal antibody paratope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination.
Basically, the antibody paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J.
Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen.
These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope.
The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.
Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region.
This allows a single antibody to be used by different types of Fc receptors, expressed on different parts of the immune system.

An institute is an organisational body created for a certain purpose.
Often they are research organisations ( research institutions ) created to do research on specific topics.
An institute can also be a professional body, or one involved in adult education, see Mechanics' Institutes .
In some countries institutes can be part of a university or other institutions of higher education , either as a group of departments or an autonomous educational institution without a traditional university status such as a university Institute.
(See Institute of Technology )
The word institute comes from a Latin word institutum meaning facility or habit; from instituere meaning build, create, raise or educate.
In some countries, such as South Korea and India , private schools are sometimes referred to as institutes, rather than schools.
In Spain secondary schools are referred to as institutes.
Comrade means friend, colleague, or ally.

Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure .
Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client.
Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries .
Construction starts with planning, design, and financing; it continues until the project is built and ready for use.
Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines.
A project manager normally manages the budget on the job, and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or architect supervises it.
Those involved with the design and execution must consider zoning requirements, environmental impact of the job, scheduling , budgeting , construction-site safety , availability and transportation of building materials , logistics, inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding .
Large construction projects are sometimes referred to as megaprojects .
A man is a male human.
The term man is usually reserved for an adult male, with the term boy being the usual term for a male child or adolescent.
However, the term man is also sometimes used to identify a male human, regardless of age, as in phrases such as men's basketball .
Like most other male mammals , a man's genome typically inherits an X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father.
The male fetus produces larger amounts of androgens and smaller amounts of estrogens than a female fetus.
This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.
During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics , thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes.
However, there are exceptions to the above for some transgender and intersex men.
Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape , or planar lamina , in the plane .
Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object .
Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat.
It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).
The area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of a fixed size.
In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit of area is the square metre (written as m ), which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long.
A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares.
In mathematics , the unit square is defined to have area one, and the area of any other shape or surface is a dimensionless real number .
There are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles , rectangles , and circles .
Using these formulas, the area of any polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles .
For shapes with curved boundary, calculus is usually required to compute the area.
Indeed, the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the historical development of calculus .
For a solid shape such as a sphere , cone, or cylinder, the area of its boundary surface is called the surface area .
Formulas for the surface areas of simple shapes were computed by the ancient Greeks , but computing the surface area of a more complicated shape usually requires multivariable calculus .
Area plays an important role in modern mathematics.
In addition to its obvious importance in geometry and calculus, area is related to the definition of determinants in linear algebra , and is a basic property of surfaces in differential geometry .
In analysis , the area of a subset of the plane is defined using Lebesgue measure , though not every subset is measurable.
In general, area in higher mathematics is seen as a special case of volume for two-dimensional regions.
Area can be defined through the use of axioms, defining it as a function of a collection of certain plane figures to the set of real numbers.
It can be proved that such a function exists.
An appendectomy is a surgical operation in which the vermiform appendix (a portion of the intestine) is removed.
Appendectomy is normally performed as an urgent or emergency procedure to treat acute appendicitis .
Appendectomy may be performed laparoscopically (as minimally invasive surgery ) or as an open operation.
Laparoscopy is often used if the diagnosis is in doubt, or in order to leave a less visible surgical scar.
Recovery may be slightly faster after laparoscopic surgery, although the laparoscopic procedure itself is more expensive and resource-intensive than open surgery and generally takes longer.
Advanced pelvic sepsis occasionally requires a lower midline laparotomy .
In US adults, the 30-day mortality after appendectomy was 1.8%.
Walking is the main form of animal locomotion on land, distinguished from running and crawling.

In biology , poisons are substances that cause death, injury or harm to organisms , usually by chemical reaction or other activity on the molecular scale, when an organism absorbs a sufficient quantity.
The fields of medicine (particularly veterinary) and zoology often distinguish a poison from a toxin , and from a venom .
Toxins are poisons produced by organisms in nature, and venoms are toxins injected by a bite or sting (this is exclusive to animals).
The difference between venom and other poisons is the delivery method.
Industry , agriculture , and other sectors employ poisonous substances for reasons other than their toxicity .
Most poisonous industrial compounds have associated material safety data sheets and are classed as hazardous substances .
Hazardous substances are subject to extensive regulation on production, procurement and use in overlapping domains of occupational safety and health , public health , drinking water quality standards , air pollution and environmental protection .
Due to the mechanics of molecular diffusion , many poisonous compounds rapidly diffuse into biological tissues, air, water, or soil on a molecular scale.
By the principle of entropy , chemical contamination is typically costly or infeasible to reverse, unless specific chelating agents or micro-filtration processes are available.
Chelating agents are often broader in scope than the acute target, and therefore their ingestion necessitates careful medical or veterinarian supervision.
Pesticides are one group of substances whose toxicity to various insects and other animals deemed to be pests (e.g., rats and cockroaches ) is their prime purpose.
Natural pesticides have been used for this purpose for thousands of years (e.g. concentrated table salt is toxic to many slugs ).
Bioaccumulation of chemically-prepared agricultural insecticides is a matter of concern for the many species, especially birds , which consume insects as a primary food source.
Selective toxicity, controlled application, and controlled biodegradation are major challenges in herbicide and pesticide development and in chemical engineering generally, as all lifeforms on earth share an underlying biochemistry ; organisms exceptional in their environmental resilience are classified as extremophiles , these for the most part exhibiting radically different susceptibilities.
A poison which enters the food chain —whether of industrial, agricultural, or natural origin—might not be immediately toxic to the first organism that ingests the toxin, but can become further concentrated in predatory organisms further up the food chain, particularly carnivores and omnivores , especially concerning fat soluble poisons which tend to become stored in biological tissue rather than excreted in urine or other water-based effluents .
Apart from food, many poisons readily enter the body through the skin and lungs .
Hydrofluoric acid is a notorious contact poison, in addition to its corrosive damage.
Naturally occurring sour gas is a notorious, fast-acting atmospheric poison (as released by volcanic activity or drilling rigs ).
Plant-based contact irritants, such as that possessed by poison ivy or poison oak , are often classed as allergens rather than poisons; the effect of an allergen being not a poison as such, but to turn the body's natural defenses against itself.
Poison can also enter the body through faulty medical implants , or by injection (which is the basis of lethal injection in the context of capital punishment ).
In 2013, 3.3 million cases of unintentional human poisonings occurred.
This resulted in 98,000 deaths worldwide, down from 120,000 deaths in 1990.
In modern society, cases of suspicious death elicit the attention of the Coroner 's office and forensic investigators .
Of increasing concern since the isolation of natural radium by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898—and the subsequent advent of nuclear physics and nuclear technologies—are radiological poisons .
These are associated with ionizing radiation , a mode of toxicity quite distinct from chemically active poisons.
In mammals , chemical poisons are often passed from mother to offspring through the placenta during gestation, or through breast milk during nursing .
In contrast, radiological damage can be passed from mother or father to offspring through genetic mutation , which—if not fatal in miscarriage or childhood , or a direct cause of infertility —can then be passed along again to a subsequent generation.
Atmospheric radon is a natural radiological poison of increasing impact since humans moved from hunter-gatherer lifestyles though cave dwelling to increasingly enclosed structures able to contain radon in dangerous concentrations.
The 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko was a novel use of radiological assassination, presumably meant to evade the normal investigation of chemical poisons.
Poisons widely dispersed into the environment are known as pollution .
These are often of human origin , but pollution can also include unwanted biological processes such as toxic red tide , or acute changes to the natural chemical environment attributed to invasive species , which are toxic or detrimental to the prior ecology (especially if the prior ecology was associated with human economic value or an established industry such as shellfish harvesting).
The scientific disciplines of ecology and environmental resource management study the environmental life cycle of toxic compounds and their complex, diffuse, and highly interrelated effects.

A report is a document that presents information in an organized format for a specific audience and purpose.
Although summaries of reports may be delivered orally, complete reports are almost always in the form of written documents.
The cat ( Felis catus ) is a small carnivorous mammal .
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family .
The cat is either a house cat or a farm cat , which are pets , or a feral cat , which ranges freely and avoids human contact.
A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents .
About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries .
Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey.
They are predators who are most active at dawn and dusk ( crepuscular ).
Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals.
Compared to humans, they see better in the dark (they see in near total darkness) and have a better sense of smell , but poorer color vision .
Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species .
Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations including meowing , purring , trilling , hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language .
Cats also communicate by secreting and perceiving pheromones .
Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two to five kittens.
Domestic cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats , a hobby known as cat fancy .
Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering , as well as abandonment of pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird species, and evoking population control .
It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in Egypt, because cats in ancient Egypt were venerated from around 3100 BC .
However, the earliest indication for the taming of an African wildcat ( F.
lybica ) was found in Cyprus , where a cat skeleton was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave dating to around 7500 BC.
African wildcats were probably first domesticated in the Near East .
The leopard cat ( Prionailurus bengalensis ) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.
As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the U.S. by number of pets owned, after freshwater fish , with 95 million cats owned.
As of 2017, it was ranked the third-most popular pet in the UK, after fish and dogs , with around 8 million being owned.
The number of cats in the United Kingdom has nearly doubled since 1965, when the cat population was 4.1 million.
Politics is a set of activities associated with the governance of a country or an area.
It involves making decisions that apply to members of a group.
It refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance—organized control over a human community, particularly a state .
The academic study focusing on just politics, which is therefore more targeted than general political science , is sometimes referred to as politology (not to be confused with politicology , a synonym for political science).
In modern nation-states , people often form political parties to represent their ideas.
Members of a party agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders.
An election is usually a competition between different parties.
Some examples of political parties worldwide are: the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa , the Democratic Party (D) in the United States , the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom , the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Germany and the Bhartiya Janata Party in India .
Politics is a multifaceted word.
It has a set of fairly specific meanings that are descriptive and nonjudgmental (such as the art or science of government and political principles), but does often colloquially carry a negative connotation.
The word has been used negatively for many years: the British national anthem as published in 1745 calls on God to Confound their politics, and the phrase play politics, for example, has been in use since at least 1853, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared: We do not play politics; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us.
A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws , and exercising force , including warfare against adversaries.
Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments , companies and institutions up to sovereign states , to the international level .
A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society.
The history of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato 's Republic , Aristotle 's Politics and the works of Confucius .
Medium may refer to:
In modern medicine , a surgeon is a physician who performs surgical operations .
There are also surgeons in podiatry , dentistry maxillofacial surgeon and the veterinary fields.
Biologically , an adult is a human or other organism that has reached sexual maturity .
In human context, the term adult additionally has meanings associated with social and legal concepts.
In contrast to a minor , a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent, self-sufficient , and responsible .
The typical age of attaining legal adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights and country.
Human adulthood encompasses psychological adult development .
Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority.
Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that may define an adult character.
In different cultures there are events that relate passing from being a child to becoming an adult or coming of age .
This often encompasses the passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood, or reaching a specified age, sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation.
Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood.
In philosophy , ideas are usually taken as mental representational images of some object .
Ideas can also be abstract concepts that do not present as mental images.
Many philosophers have considered ideas to be a fundamental ontological category of being .
The capacity to create and understand the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of human beings .
In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious reflection , for example, when we talk about the idea of a person or a place.
A new or original idea can often lead to innovation .
Health , as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity .
This definition has been subject to controversy, as it may have limited value for implementation.
Health may be defined as the ability to adapt and manage physical, mental and social challenges throughout life.
In physics , motion is the change in position of an object with respect to its surroundings in a given interval of time.
Motion is mathematically described in terms of displacement , distance , velocity , acceleration , and speed .
Motion of a body is observed by attaching a frame of reference to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame.
If the position of an object is not changing with respect to a given frame of reference (reference point), the object is said to be at rest , motionless , immobile , stationary , or to have constant ( time-invariant ) position with reference to its surroundings.
Momentum is a quantity which is used for measuring the motion of an object.
An object's momentum is directly related to the object's mass and velocity, and the total momentum of all objects in an isolated system (one not affected by external forces) does not change with time, as described by the law of conservation of momentum .
An object's motion cannot change unless it is acted upon by a force .
As there is no absolute frame of reference, absolute motion cannot be determined.
Thus, everything in the universe can be considered to be moving.
Motion applies to various physical systems: to objects, bodies, matter particles, matter fields, radiation, radiation fields, radiation particles, curvature and space-time.
One can also speak of motion of images, shapes and boundaries.
So, the term motion, in general, signifies a continuous change in the configuration of a physical system in space.
For example, one can talk about motion of a wave or about motion of a quantum particle, where the configuration consists of probabilities of occupying specific positions.
Visual perception is the ability to interpret the surrounding environment using light in the visible spectrum reflected by the objects in the environment .
This is different from visual acuity , which refers to how clearly a person sees (for example 20/20 vision).
A person can have problems with visual perceptual processing even if he/she has 20/20 vision.
The resulting perception is also known as visual perception, eyesight , sight , or vision ( adjectival form : visual , optical , or ocular ).
The various physiological components involved in vision are referred to collectively as the visual system , and are the focus of much research in linguistics , psychology , cognitive science , neuroscience , and molecular biology , collectively referred to as vision science .
Death is the permanent cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism .
Phenomena which commonly bring about death include aging , predation , malnutrition , disease , suicide , homicide , starvation , dehydration , and accidents or major trauma resulting in terminal injury .
In most cases, bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death.
Death – particularly the death of humans – has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion, due to the affection for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial bonds with the deceased.
Other concerns include fear of death , necrophobia , anxiety , sorrow , grief , emotional pain , depression , sympathy , compassion , solitude , or saudade .
Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife , and also hold the idea of reward or judgement and punishment for past sin .
A corporation is an organization, usually a group of people or a company , authorized by the state to act as a single entity ( legally a person ) and recognized as such in law for certain purposes.
Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an ad hoc act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature).
Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration .
Corporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered into two kinds: by whether they can issue stock or not, or by whether they are formed to make a profit or not.
Corporations can be divided by the number of owners: corporation aggregate or corporation sole .
The subject of this article is a corporation aggregate.
A corporation sole is a legal entity consisting of a single (sole) incorporated office, occupied by a single (sole) natural person .
Where local law distinguishes corporations by the ability to issue stock, corporations allowed to do so are referred to as stock corporations, ownership of the corporation is through stock, and owners of stock are referred to as stockholders or shareholders.
Corporations not allowed to issue stock are referred to as non-stock corporations; those who are considered the owners of a non-stock corporation are persons (or other entities) who have obtained membership in the corporation and are referred to as a member of the corporation.
Corporations chartered in regions where they are distinguished by whether they are allowed to be for profit or not are referred to as for profit and not-for-profit corporations, respectively.
There is some overlap between stock/non-stock and for-profit/not-for-profit in that not-for-profit corporations are always non-stock as well.
A for-profit corporation is almost always a stock corporation, but some for-profit corporations may choose to be non-stock.
To simplify the explanation, whenever Stockholder or shareholder is used in the rest of this article to refer to a stock corporation, it is presumed to mean the same as member for a non-profit corporation or for a profit, non-stock corporation.
Registered corporations have legal personality and their shares are owned by shareholders whose liability is generally limited to their investment.
Shareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation; shareholders instead elect or appoint a board of directors to control the corporation in a fiduciary capacity.
In most circumstances, a shareholder may also serve as a director or officer of a corporation.
In American English , the word corporation is most often used to describe large business corporations .
In British English and in the Commonwealth countries , the term company is more widely used to describe the same sort of entity while the word corporation encompasses all incorporated entities.
In American English, the word company can include entities such as partnerships that would not be referred to as companies in British English as they are not a separate legal entity .
Late in the 19th century, a new form of company having the limited liability protections of a corporation, and the more favorable tax treatment of either a sole proprietorship or partnership was developed.
While not a corporation, this new type of entity became very attractive as an alternative for corporations not needing to issue stock.
In Germany, the organization was referred to as Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung or GmbH .
In the last quarter of the 20th Century this new form of non-corporate organization became available in the United States and other countries, and was known as the limited liability company or LLC .
Since the GmbH and LLC forms of organization are technically not corporations (even though they have many of the same features), they will not be discussed in this article.
A tax (from the Latin taxo ) is a compulsory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity ) by a governmental organization in order to fund various public expenditures.
A failure to pay, along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law.
Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent.
The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC.
Most countries have a tax system in place to pay for public, common or agreed national needs and government functions.
Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes based on annual income amounts.
Most countries charge a tax on individuals income as well as on corporate income .
Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes , inheritance taxes , estate taxes , gift taxes , property taxes , sales taxes , payroll taxes or tariffs .
In economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government.
This has effects which can both increase and reduce economic growth and economic welfare.
Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic.
Bias is disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea or thing, usually in a way that is closed-minded , prejudicial , or unfair.
Biases can be innate or learned.
People may develop biases for or against an individual, a group, or a belief.
In science and engineering, a bias is a systematic error .
Statistical bias results from an unfair sampling of a population, or from an estimation process that does not give accurate results on average.

Intellect is a term used in studies of the human mind , and refers to the ability of the mind to come to correct conclusions about what is true or real , and about how to solve problems .
Historically the term comes from the Greek philosophical term nous , which was translated into Latin as intellectus (derived from the verb intelligere , to understand, from inter , between and legere , to choose ) and into French and then English as intelligence (other than intellect ).
Intellect is in fact considered as a branch of intelligence (see Intellect vs intelligence ).
Discussion of the intellect can be divided into two broad areas.
In both of these areas, the terms intellect and intelligence have continued to be used as related words.
A person who uses intelligence (thought and reason) and critical or analytical reasoning in either a professional or a personal capacity is often referred to as an intellectual .
Rights are legal , social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement ; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.
Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics , especially theories of justice and deontology .
Rights are often considered fundamental to civilization , for they are regarded as established pillars of society and culture , and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development.
According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy , rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws , and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived.
Line , lines , or LINE may refer to:
A camera is an optical instrument to capture still images or to record moving images , which are stored in a physical medium such as in a digital system or on photographic film .
A camera consists of a lens which focuses light from the scene, and a camera body which holds the image capture mechanism.
The still image camera is the main instrument in the art of photography and captured images may be reproduced later as a part of the process of photography, digital imaging , photographic printing .
The similar artistic fields in the moving image camera domain are film , videography , and cinematography .
The word camera comes from camera obscura , which means dark chamber and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external reality onto a flat surface.
The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura.
The functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of the human eye.
The first permanent photograph was made in 1825 by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce .
A finger is a limb of the human body and a type of digit , an organ of manipulation and sensation found in the hands of humans and other primates .
Normally humans have five digits, the bones of which are termed phalanges, on each hand, although some people have more or fewer than five due to congenital disorders such as polydactyly or oligodactyly , or accidental or medical amputations .
The first digit is the thumb , followed by index finger , middle finger , ring finger , and little finger or pinkie.
According to different definitions, the thumb can be called a finger, or not.
A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity , is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion , and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals .
The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology , science, mythology , and religion.
Five planets in the Solar System are visible to the naked eye .
These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities .
As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects.
In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System.
This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit.
Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain planets under the current definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres , Pallas , Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as planets under the current definition of planet .
Planets in astrology have a different definition.
The planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle motions.
Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations , performed by Galileo Galilei .
About the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observational data collected by Tycho Brahe , Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were elliptical rather than circular .
As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, each of the planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole , and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons .
Since the dawn of the Space Age , close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism , hurricanes , tectonics , and even hydrology .
Planets are generally divided into two main types: large low-density giant planets , and smaller rocky terrestrials .
There are eight planets in the Solar System.
In order of increasing distance from the Sun , they are the four terrestrials, Mercury , Venus , Earth, and Mars , then the four giant planets, Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune .
Six of the planets are orbited by one or more natural satellites .
Several thousands of planets around other stars ( extrasolar planets or exoplanets) have been discovered in the Milky Way .
As of 1 August 2019, 4,103 known extrasolar planets in 3,056 planetary systems (including 665 multiple planetary systems ), ranging in size from just above the size of the Moon to gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter have been discovered, out of which more than 100 planets are the same size as Earth , nine of which are at the same relative distance from their star as Earth from the Sun, i.e. in the circumstellar habitable zone .
On December 20, 2011, the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets, Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f , orbiting a Sun-like star , Kepler-20 .
A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data, estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way.
Around one in five Sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone.
China ( Chinese : 中国 ; pinyin : Zhōngguó ; lit.
Middle Kingdom), officially the People's Republic of China ( PRC ), is a country in East Asia and the world's most populous country , with a population of around 1.404 billion .
Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the fourth largest country by total area .
Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau .
China emerged as one of the world's earliest civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain .
For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties , beginning with the semi-legendary Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE .
Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times.
In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire .
The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BC until 220 AD, saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements.
The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Northern Song (960–1127) completed the Four Great Inventions .
Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa .
Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the republic replaced the Qing dynasty .
China as a whole was ravaged by Japan during World War II , and the subsequent Chinese Civil War resulted in a division of territory in 1949, when the Communist Party of China established the People's Republic of China, a unitary one-party sovereign state on the majority of China , while the Kuomintang -led nationalist government retreated to the island of Taiwan .
The political status of Taiwan remains disputed.
Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978 , China's economy has been one of the world's fastest-growing with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent.
According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017.
According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion Yuan ($13.28 trillion).
Since 2010, China has been the world's second-largest economy by nominal GDP and since 2014, the largest economy in the world by purchasing power parity (PPP).
China is also the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods.
China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army and second-largest defense budget .
The PRC is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council as it replaced the ROC in 1971, as well as an active global partner of ASEAN Plus mechanism .
China is also a leading member of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations, including the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) , WTO , APEC , BRICS , the BCIM , and the G20 .
China has been characterized as an emerging superpower , mainly because of its massive population, economy, and military.
Way is a road , route , path or pathway, including long distance paths .

The tomato is the edible, often red, berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum , commonly known as a tomato plant.
The species originated in western South America and Central America .
The Nahuatl (Aztec language) word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate , from which the English word tomato derived.
Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico .
The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire , and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs , they brought the plant to Europe.
From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.
Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor.
The tomato is consumed in diverse ways, raw or cooked, in many dishes, sauces, salads , and drinks.
While tomatoes are fruits — botanically classified as berries —they are commonly used as a vegetable ingredient or side dish .
Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year.
Tomato plants typically grow to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) in height.
They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support.
Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, but are cultivated as annuals .
Determinate, or bush, plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once.
The size of the tomato varies according to the cultivar , with a range of 0.5–4 inches (1.3–10.2 cm) in width.

April is the fourth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar , the fifth in the early Julian , the first of four months to have a length of 30 days, and the second of five months to have a length of less than 31 days.
April is commonly associated with the season of autumn in parts of the Southern Hemisphere , and spring in parts of the Northern Hemisphere , where it is the seasonal equivalent to October in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa.
The bit is a basic unit of information in information theory , computing , and digital communications .
The name is a portmanteau of binary digit .
In information theory , one bit is typically defined as the information entropy of a binary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability, or the information that is gained when the value of such a variable becomes known.
As a unit of information , the bit has also been called a shannon , named after Claude Shannon .
As a binary digit, the bit represents a logical value , having only one of two values .
It may be physically implemented with a two-state device.
These state values are most commonly represented as either 0 or 1 , but other representations such as true/false , yes/no , +/− , or on/off are possible.
The correspondence between these values and the physical states of the underlying storage or device is a matter of convention, and different assignments may be used even within the same device or program .
The symbol for the binary digit is either simply bit per recommendation by the IEC 80000-13 :2008 standard, or the lowercase character b , as recommended by the IEEE 1541-2002 and IEEE Std 260.1-2004 standards.
A group of eight binary digits is commonly called one byte , but historically the size of the byte is not strictly defined.
Snow refers to forms of ice crystals that precipitate from the atmosphere (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the Earth's surface.
It pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away.
Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air.
Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals.
Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime .
As snow accumulates into a snowpack , it may blow into drifts.
Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering , sublimation and freeze-thaw .
Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form.
Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater .
Major snow-prone areas include the polar regions , the upper half of the Northern Hemisphere and mountainous regions worldwide with sufficient moisture and cold temperatures.
In the Southern Hemisphere , snow is confined primarily to mountainous areas, apart from Antarctica .
Snow affects such human activities as transportation : creating the need for keeping roadways, wings, and windows clear; agriculture : providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock; sports such as skiing , snowboarding , and snowmachine travel; and warfare .
Snow affects ecosystems , as well, by providing an insulating layer during winter under which plants and animals are able to survive the cold.
A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit .
Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets .
Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries.
Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities.
In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords .
Banking in its modern sense evolved in the 14th century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world .
In the history of banking , a number of banking dynasties – notably, the Medicis , the Fuggers , the Welsers , the Berenbergs , and the Rothschilds – have played a central role over many centuries.
The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena , while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank .

A microprocessor is a computer processor that incorporates the functions of a central processing unit on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits.
The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory and provides results as output.
Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic .
Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system .
The integration of a whole CPU onto a single or a few integrated circuits greatly reduced the cost of processing power.
Integrated circuit processors are produced in large numbers by highly automated processes , resulting in a low unit price .
Single-chip processors increase reliability because there are many fewer electrical connections that could fail.
As microprocessor designs improve, the cost of manufacturing a chip (with smaller components built on a semiconductor chip the same size) generally stays the same according to Rock's law .
Before microprocessors, small computers had been built using racks of circuit boards with many medium- and small-scale integrated circuits .
Microprocessors combined this into one or a few large-scale ICs. Continued increases in microprocessor capacity have since rendered other forms of computers almost completely obsolete (see history of computing hardware ), with one or more microprocessors used in everything from the smallest embedded systems and handheld devices to the largest mainframes and supercomputers .
Pink is a pale red color that is named after a flower of the same name .
It was first used as a color name in the late 17th century.
According to surveys in Europe and the United States, pink is the color most often associated with charm, politeness, sensitivity, tenderness, sweetness, childhood, femininity and the romantic.
A combination of pink and white is associated with chastity and innocence, whereas a combination of pink and black links to eroticism and seduction.
Cab or CAB may refer to:
Medicine is the science and practice of establishing the diagnosis , prognosis , treatment , and prevention of disease .
Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness .
Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences , biomedical research , genetics , and medical technology to diagnose , treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery , but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy , external splints and traction , medical devices , biologics , and ionizing radiation , amongst others.
Medicine has been around for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture.
For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism .
In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science , most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied , under the umbrella of medical science ).
While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.
Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine , though they do not fall within the modern definition of “medicine” which is based in medical science.
Traditional medicine and folk medicine remain commonly used with, or instead of, scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine (meaning “something other than medicine”, from Latin alter , “other”).
For example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is variable and inconsistent for any condition, but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner.
In contrast, alternative treatments outside the bounds not just of scientific medicine, but also outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery .
Quackery can encompass an array of practices and practitioners, irrespective of whether they are prescientific (traditional medicine and folk medicine) or modern pseudo-scientific , including chiropractic which rejects modern scientific germ theory of disease (instead believing without evidence that human diseases are caused by invisible subluxation of the bones, predominately of the spine and less so of other bones), with just over half of chiropractors also rejecting the science of immunization .
A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun .
Due to the Earth's axial tilt , the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons , marked by change in weather , the hours of daylight , and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility .In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring , summer , autumn , and winter .
In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics , the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked.
A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period as counted in a given calendar .
The Gregorian calendar , or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars ; see below .
For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days.
The ISO standard ISO 80000-3 , Annex C, supports the symbol a (for Latin annus ) to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days.
In English, the abbreviations y and yr are commonly used.
In astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time ; it is defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds ( SI base unit ), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.
The word year is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the seasonal year , the fiscal year , the academic year , etc.
Similarly, year can mean the orbital period of any planet ; for example, a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit.
The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the Great Year .
A woman is a female human being.
The word woman is usually reserved for an adult ; girl is the usual term for a female child or adolescent .
The plural women is also sometimes used for female humans, regardless of age, as in phrases such as women's rights .
Typically, a woman has two X chromosomes and is capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause .
Female anatomy, as distinguished from male anatomy, includes the fallopian tubes , ovaries , uterus , vulva , breasts , Skene's glands , and Bartholin's glands .
The female pelvis is wider than the male, the hips are generally broader, and women have significantly less facial and other body hair.
On average, women are shorter than men.
Throughout human history , traditional gender roles have often defined and limited women's activities and opportunities; many religious doctrines stipulate certain rules for women.
With restrictions loosening during the 20th century, women in many societies have access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker and are free to pursue higher education.
Violence against women , whether within families or in communities, has a long history, and is primarily committed by men.
Some women are denied reproductive rights .
The movements and ideologies of feminism have a shared goal of achieving gender equality .
Some women are trans (those who have a male sex assignment that does not align with their gender identity ), or intersex (those born with sexual characteristics that do not fit typical notions of male or female).
Specialist may refer to:
A defendant is a person accused of committing a crime in criminal prosecution or a person against whom some type of civil relief is being sought in a civil case .
Terminology varies from one jurisdiction to another.
For example, Scots law does not use the term defendant; the terms accused or panel are used instead in criminal proceedings, and defender in civil proceedings.
In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority.
The term crime does not, in modern criminal law , have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.
The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law ; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law.
One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence ) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society or the state (a public wrong ).
Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.
The notion that acts such as murder , rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide.
What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country.
While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code , in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.
The state ( government ) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime.
In modern societies , there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere.
If found guilty , an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence , or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment , life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions , execution .
Usually, to be classified as a crime, the act of doing something criminal ( actus reus ) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the intention to do something criminal ( mens rea ).
While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.
Breaches of private law ( torts and breaches of contract ) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure .
Study or studies may refer to:
Color ( American English ), or colour ( Commonwealth English ), is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color categories , with names such as red , orange , yellow , green , blue , or purple .
This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum .
Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them.
This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc.
By defining a color space , colors can be identified numerically by coordinates, which in 1931 were also named in global agreement with internationally agreed color names like mentioned above (red, orange, etc.) by the International Commission on Illumination .
The RGB color space for instance is a color space corresponding to human trichromacy and to the three cone cell types that respond to three bands of light: long wavelengths, peaking near 564–580 nm ( red ); medium-wavelength, peaking near 534–545 nm ( green ); and short-wavelength light, near 420–440 nm ( blue ).
There may also be more than three color dimensions in other color spaces, such as in the CMYK color model , wherein one of the dimensions relates to a color's colorfulness ).
The photo-receptivity of the eyes of other species also varies considerably from that of humans and so results in correspondingly different color perceptions that cannot readily be compared to one another.
Honeybees and bumblebees for instance have trichromatic color vision sensitive to ultraviolet but is insensitive to red.
Papilio butterflies possess six types of photoreceptors and may have pentachromatic vision.
The most complex color vision system in the animal kingdom has been found in stomatopods (such as the mantis shrimp ) with up to 12 spectral receptor types thought to work as multiple dichromatic units.
The science of color is sometimes called chromatics , colorimetry , or simply color science .
It includes the study of the perception of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, color theory in art , and the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range (that is, what is commonly referred to simply as light ).
The middle class is a class of people in the middle of a social hierarchy .
The very definition of the term middle class is highly political and vigorously contested by various schools of political and economic philosophy.
Modern social theorists - and especially economists - have defined and re-defined the term middle class in order to serve their particular political ends.
The definitions of the term middle class therefore are the result of the more- or less-scientific methods used when delineating the parameters of what is and isn't middle class.
In Weberian socioeconomic terms, the middle class is the broad group of people in contemporary society who fall socio-economically between the working class and upper class .
The common measures of what constitutes middle class vary significantly among cultures.
One of the narrowest definitions limits it to those in the middle fifth of the nation's income ladder.
A wider characterization includes everyone but the poorest 20% and the wealthiest 20%.
In modern American vernacular usage, the term middle class is most often used as a self-description by those persons whom academics and Marxists would otherwise identify as the working class which are below both the upper class and the true middle class, but above those in poverty .
This leads to considerable ambiguity over the meaning of the term middle class in American usage.
Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert and Joseph Kahl see this American self-described middle class (i.e. working class) as the most populous class in the United States.
Fear is a feeling induced by perceived danger or threat that occurs in certain types of organisms , which causes a change in metabolic and organ functions and ultimately a change in behavior , such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events.
Fear in human beings may occur in response to a certain stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to body or life.
The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response ), which in extreme cases of fear ( horror and terror ) can be a freeze response or paralysis .
In humans and animals, fear is modulated by the process of cognition and learning.
Thus fear is judged as rational or appropriate and irrational or inappropriate.
An irrational fear is called a phobia .
Psychologists such as John B.
Watson , Robert Plutchik , and Paul Ekman have suggested that there is only a small set of basic or innate emotions and that fear is one of them.
This hypothesized set includes such emotions as acute stress reaction , anger , angst , anxiety , fright, horror , joy , panic , and sadness .
Fear is closely related to, but should be distinguished from, the emotion anxiety , which occurs as the result of threats that are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable.
The fear response serves survival by engendering appropriate behavioral responses, so it has been preserved throughout evolution .
Sociological and organizational research also suggests that individuals fears are not solely dependent on their nature but are also shaped by their social relations and culture, which guide their understanding of when and how much fear to feel.
Marriage , also called matrimony or wedlock , is a culturally recognised union between people, called spouses , that establishes rights and obligations between them, as well as between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws .
The definition of marriage varies around the world not only between cultures and between religions, but also throughout the history of any given culture and religion, evolving to both expand and constrict in who and what is encompassed, but typically it is principally an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually sexual , are acknowledged or sanctioned.
In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory before pursuing any sexual activity .
When defined broadly, marriage is considered a cultural universal .
Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares that Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family.
They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.
Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.
Individuals may marry for several reasons, including legal, social, libidinal , emotional, financial, spiritual , and religious purposes.
Whom they marry may be influenced by gender , socially determined rules of incest , prescriptive marriage rules , parental choice and individual desire.
In some areas of the world, arranged marriage , child marriage , polygamy , and sometimes forced marriage , may be practiced as a cultural tradition.
Conversely, such practices may be outlawed and penalized in parts of the world out of concerns of the infringement of women's rights, or the infringement of children's rights (both female and male children), and because of international law.
Around the world, primarily in developed democracies, there has been a general trend towards ensuring equal rights within marriage for women and legally recognizing the marriages of interfaith , interracial , and same-sex couples.
These trends coincide with the broader human rights movement .
Marriage can be recognized by a state , an organization , a religious authority, a tribal group , a local community , or peers.
It is often viewed as a contract .
When a marriage is performed and carried out by a government institution in accordance with the marriage laws of the jurisdiction, without religious content, it is a civil marriage .
Civil marriage recognizes and creates the rights and obligations intrinsic to matrimony before the state.
When a marriage is performed with religious content under the auspices of a religious institution it is a religious marriage.
Religious marriage recognizes and creates the rights and obligations intrinsic to matrimony before that religion.
Religious marriage is known variously as sacramental marriage in Catholicism , nikah in Islam , nissuin in Judaism , and various other names in other faith traditions, each with their own constraints as to what constitutes, and who can enter into, a valid religious marriage.
Some countries do not recognize locally performed religious marriage on its own, and require a separate civil marriage for official purposes.
Conversely, civil marriage does not exist in some countries governed by a religious legal system , such as Saudi Arabia , where marriages contracted abroad might not be recognized if they were contracted contrary to Saudi interpretations of Islamic religious law .
In countries governed by a mixed secular-religious legal system , such as in Lebanon and Israel , locally performed civil marriage also does not exist within the country, preventing interfaith and various other marriages contradicting religious laws from being entered into in the country, however, civil marriages performed abroad may be recognized by the state even if they conflict with religious laws (in the case of recognition of marriage in Israel , this includes recognition of not only interfaith civil marriages performed abroad, but also overseas same-sex civil marriages).
The act of marriage usually creates normative or legal obligations between the individuals involved, and any offspring they may produce or adopt.
In terms of legal recognition, most sovereign states and other jurisdictions limit marriage to opposite-sex couples and a diminishing number of these permit polygyny , child marriages , and forced marriages .
In modern times, a growing number of countries, primarily developed democracies, have lifted bans on and have established legal recognition for the marriages of interfaith , interracial , and same-sex couples.
Some cultures allow the dissolution of marriage through divorce or annulment .
In some areas, child marriages and polygamy may occur in spite of national laws against the practice.
Since the late twentieth century, major social changes in Western countries have led to changes in the demographics of marriage, with the age of first marriage increasing, fewer people marrying, and more couples choosing to cohabit rather than marry.
For example, the number of marriages in Europe decreased by 30% from 1975 to 2005.
Historically, in most cultures, married women had very few rights of their own, being considered, along with the family's children, the property of the husband ; as such, they could not own or inherit property, or represent themselves legally (see for example coverture ).
In Europe, the United States, and other places in the developed world , beginning in the late 19th century and lasting through the 21st century, marriage has undergone gradual legal changes, aimed at improving the rights of the wife.
These changes included giving wives legal identities of their own, abolishing the right of husbands to physically discipline their wives, giving wives property rights, liberalizing divorce laws, providing wives with reproductive rights of their own, and requiring a wife 's consent when sexual relations occur.
These changes have occurred primarily in Western countries .
In the 21st century, there continue to be controversies regarding the legal status of married women, legal acceptance of or leniency towards violence within marriage (especially sexual violence), traditional marriage customs such as dowry and bride price , forced marriage, marriageable age , and criminalization of consensual behaviors such as premarital and extramarital sex .
Ted may refer to:
A shortened form of the following:
In production , research , retail , and accounting , a cost is the value of money that has been used up to produce something or deliver a service, and hence is not available for use anymore.
In business , the cost may be one of acquisition, in which case the amount of money expended to acquire it is counted as cost.
In this case, money is the input that is gone in order to acquire the thing.
This acquisition cost may be the sum of the cost of production as incurred by the original producer, and further costs of transaction as incurred by the acquirer over and above the price paid to the producer.
Usually, the price also includes a mark-up for profit over the cost of production.
More generalized in the field of economics , cost is a metric that is totaling up as a result of a process or as a differential for the result of a decision .
Hence cost is the metric used in the standard modeling paradigm applied to economic processes .
Costs (pl.) are often further described based on their timing or their applicability.
A prison , also known as a correctional facility , jail , gaol (dated, British and Australian English), penitentiary ( American English ), detention center ( American English ), remand center , or internment facility (commonly used term in military theatres of war/involvement), is a facility in which inmates are forcibly confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state .
Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial ; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment.
In simplest terms, a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed.
Prisons can also be used as a tool of political repression by authoritarian regimes.
Their perceived opponents may be imprisoned for political crimes , often without trial or other legal due process ; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice.
In times of war, prisoners of war or detainees may be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps , and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps .
In American English , prison and jail are usually treated as having separate definitions.
The term prison or penitentiary tends to describe institutions that incarcerate people for longer periods of time, such as many years, and are operated by the state or federal governments.
The term jail tends to describe institutions for confining people for shorter periods of time (e.g. for shorter sentences or pre-trial detention ) and are usually operated by local governments.
Outside of North America, prison and jail have the same meaning.
Common slang terms for a prison include: the pokey, the slammer, the can, the clink, the joint, the calaboose, the hoosegow and the big house.
Slang terms for imprisonment include: behind bars, in stir and up the river (a possible reference to Sing Sing ).
Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life .
According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago .
Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon , Earth's only natural satellite .
Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year .
During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.
Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth.
The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides , stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis and gradually slows its rotation .
Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four terrestrial planets .
Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years.
About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water , mostly by oceans .
The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together contain many lakes , rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere .
The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice , including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack .
Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core , a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.
Within the first billion years of Earth's history , life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later , aerobic organisms .
Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago.
Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive.
In the history of life on Earth , biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events .
Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct .
Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been described .
Over 7.6 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival.
Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures ; politically, the world has around 200 sovereign states .
Night or nighttime ( sp.
night-time or night time ) is the period from sunset to sunrise in each twenty-four hours, when the Sun is below the horizon .
However, it can be defined differently and is subjective.
Night can be defined as the time between bedtime and morning .
There is no exact time for when night begins and ends (equally true with evening ).
The start of night begins when evening ends, which is subjective, but is typically believed to end at astronomical sunset, which is when night may begin.
There can be no precise definition in terms of clock time, but it is usually considered to start around 9 pm and to last to about 5 am.
Since sunset and sunrise vary throughout the year there can be no precise definition in terms of clock time.
Night and morning overlap when one considers morning to start past 12 am (however, this is subjective and many others consider morning to begin at sunrise), which can be described as 'morning-night duality'.
Night is used as a farewell (good night) and sometimes shortened to night.
Unlike good morning , good afternoon , and good evening , good night is typically not used a greeting .
Complete darkness or astronomical night is the period between astronomical dusk and astronomical dawn when the Sun is between 18 and 90 degrees below the horizon and does not illuminate the sky.
As seen from latitudes between 48.5° and 66.5° north or south of the Equator , complete darkness does not occur around the summer solstice because although the Sun sets, it is never more than 18° below the horizon at lower culmination .
The opposite of night is day (or daytime , to distinguish it from day referring to a 24-hour period).
The start and end points of time for a night vary, based on factors such as season and latitude .
Twilight is the period of night after sunset or before sunrise when the Sun still illuminates the sky when it is below the horizon.
At any given time, one side of Earth is bathed in sunlight (the daytime) while the other side is in the shadow caused by Earth blocking the sunlight.
The central part of the shadow is called the umbra .
Natural illumination at night is still provided by a combination of moonlight , planetary light , starlight , zodiacal light , gegenschein , and airglow .
In some circumstances, aurorae , lightning , and bioluminescence can provide some illumination.
The glow provided by artificial lighting is sometimes referred to as light pollution because it can interfere with observational astronomy and ecosystems .
A gift or a present is an item given to someone without the expectation of payment or anything in return.
An item is not a gift if that item is already owned by the one to whom it is given.
Although gift-giving might involve an expectation of reciprocity, a gift is meant to be free.
In many countries, the act of mutually exchanging money , goods , etc.
may sustain social relations and contribute to social cohesion.
Economists have elaborated the economics of gift-giving into the notion of a gift economy .
By extension the term gift can refer to any item or act of service that makes the other happier or less sad, especially as a favor, including forgiveness and kindness .
Gifts are also first and foremost presented on occasions such as birthdays and holidays.
Identity may refer to:
The future is the time after the present .
Its arrival is considered inevitable due to the existence of time and the laws of physics .
Due to the apparent nature of reality and the unavoidability of the future, everything that currently exists and will exist can be categorized as either permanent, meaning that it will exist forever, or temporary, meaning that it will end.
In the Occidental view, which uses a linear conception of time, the future is the portion of the projected timeline that is anticipated to occur.
In special relativity , the future is considered absolute future , or the future light cone .
In the philosophy of time , presentism is the belief that only the present exists and the future and the past are unreal .
Religions consider the future when they address issues such as karma , life after death , and eschatologies that study what the end of time and the end of the world will be.
Religious figures such as prophets and diviners have claimed to see into the future.
Future studies, or futurology , is the science, art, and practice of postulating possible futures.
Modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability , versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.
The concept of the future has been explored extensively in cultural production, including art movements and genres devoted entirely to its elucidation, such as the 20th-century movement futurism .
The face is the front of an animal's head that features three of the head's sense organs , the eyes, nose, and mouth, and through which animals express many of their emotions .
The face is crucial for human identity , and damage such as scarring or developmental deformities affects the psyche adversely.
Mats Johan Sundin ( Swedish pronunciation: ˈmatːs sɵnˈdiːn ; born 13 February 1971) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey player who played the majority of his career in the National Hockey League (NHL), retiring in 2009.
Originally drafted first overall in 1989 , Sundin played his first four seasons in the NHL with the Quebec Nordiques .
He was then traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1994, where he played the majority of his career, serving 11 seasons as team captain .
At the end of the 2007–08 season , Sundin was the longest serving non-North American born captain in NHL history.
Sundin last played for the Vancouver Canucks in the 2008–09 season before announcing his retirement on 30 September 2009.
He appeared in the Stanley Cup playoffs in 10 of his 18 seasons.
Excluding his rookie season, the shortened lockout season and his half season with Vancouver, Sundin scored at least 70 points in every season of his career, played at least 70 games in every season and led the Maple Leafs in points in every year he was with the team save for 2002–03 , when Alexander Mogilny beat him by seven points.
On 14 October 2006, Sundin became the first Swedish player to score 500 goals .
He is the Maple Leafs' franchise all-time leader in goals (420) and points (987).
Over his career, Sundin averaged just over a point per game (1,349 points in 1,346 NHL games).
Internationally, Sundin won three gold medals with Sweden at the World Championships and a gold medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin .
Sundin was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame on 26 June 2012, in his first year of eligibility.
He became the second Swede, following Börje Salming (another long-time Maple Leafs player), to be chosen to the Hall of Fame.
Sundin was also inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2013.
In 2017 Sundin was named one of the ' 100 Greatest NHL Players ' in history.
An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident: a story with a point, such as to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative or to characterize by delineating a specific quirk or trait.
Occasionally humorous , anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself.
Anecdotes may be real or fictional; the anecdotal digression is a common feature of literary works and even oral anecdotes typically involve subtle exaggeration and dramatic shape designed to entertain the listener.
An anecdote is always presented as the recounting of a real incident involving actual persons and usually in an identifiable place.
In the words of Jürgen Hein, they exhibit a special realism and a claimed historical dimension.
Neglect is a form of abuse where the perpetrator, who is responsible for caring for someone who is unable to care for themselves, fails to do so.
It can be a result of carelessness, indifference, or unwillingness.
Neglect may include the failure to provide sufficient supervision, nourishment, or medical care, or the failure to fulfill other needs for which the victim cannot provide themselves.
The term is also applied when necessary care is withheld by those responsible for providing it from animals, plants, and even inanimate objects.
Neglect can carry on in a child's life falling into many long-term side effects such as: physical injuries, developmental trauma disorder , low self-esteem , attention disorders, violent behavior, and can even cause death.
A reef is a bar of rock, sand, coral or similar material, lying beneath the surface of water.Many reefs result from natural, abiotic processes— deposition of sand, wave erosion planing down rock outcrops, etc.—but the best known reefs are the coral reefs of tropical waters developed through biotic processes dominated by corals and coralline algae .
Artificial reefs (e.g. shipwrecks) sometimes have a role in enhancing the physical complexity of featureless sand bottoms, in order to attract a diverse assemblage of organisms, especially algae and fish.
Earth's largest reef system is the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, at a length of over 2,300 kilometres (1,400 miles).
Citizenship is the status of a person recognized under the custom or law as being a legal member of a sovereign state or belonging to a nation .
A person may have multiple citizenships .
A person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be stateless , while one who lives on state borders whose territorial status is uncertain is a border-lander.
Nationality is often used as a synonym for citizenship in English – notably in international law – although the term is sometimes understood as denoting a person's membership of a nation (a large ethnic group ).
In some countries, e.g. the United States , the United Kingdom , nationality and citizenship can have different meanings (for more information, see Nationality versus citizenship ).
Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them.
A typology of shopper types has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as recreational shoppers, that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity.
Online shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail industry.
Consumers can now search for product information and place product orders across different regions while online retailers deliver their products directly to the consumers' home, offices or wherever they want.
The B2C (business to consumer) process has made it easy for consumers to select any product online from a retailer's website and to have it delivered relatively quickly.
Using online shopping methods, consumers do not need to consume energy by physically visiting physical stores, but save time and the cost of travelling.
A retailer or a shop is a business that presents a selection of goods and offers to trade or sell them to customers for money or other goods.
Shoppers' shopping experiences may vary, based on a variety of factors including how the customer is treated, convenience, the type of goods being purchased, and mood.
According to a 2000 report, in New York State , women purchase 80% of all consumer goods .
Mama ( s ) or Mamma may refer to:
Failure is the state or condition of not meeting a desirable or intended objective , and may be viewed as the opposite of success .
Product failure ranges from failure to sell the product to fracture of the product, in the worst cases leading to personal injury, the province of forensic engineering .
A puzzle is a game , problem , or toy that tests a person's ingenuity or knowledge .
In a puzzle, the solver is expected to put pieces together in a logical way, in order to arrive at the correct or fun solution of the puzzle.
There are different genres of puzzles, such as crossword puzzles, word-search puzzles, number puzzles, relational puzzles, or logic puzzles.
Puzzles are often created to be a form of entertainment but they can also arise from serious mathematical or logistical problems.
In such cases, their solution may be a significant contribution to mathematical research.
Point or points may refer to:
Abstraction in its main sense is a conceptual process where general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal (real or concrete ) signifiers, first principles , or other methods.
An abstraction is the outcome of this process—a concept that acts as a common noun for all subordinate concepts, and connects any related concepts as a group , field , or category .
Conceptual abstractions may be formed by filtering the information content of a concept or an observable phenomenon , selecting only the aspects which are relevant for a particular subjectively valued purpose.
For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, excluding, but not eliminating, the other phenomenal and cognitive characteristics of that particular ball.
In a type–token distinction , a type (e.g., a 'ball') is more abstract than its tokens (e.g., 'that leather soccer ball').
Abstraction in its secondary use is a material process , discussed in the themes below .
Authority is the right to exercise power , which can be formalized by a state and exercised by way of judges, appointed executives of government, or the ecclesiastical or priestly appointed representatives of a God or other deities .
Authority, in the sense of authorization, can also mean the right to complete an action or execute an order.
In government , authority is often used interchangeably with power .
However, their meanings differ: while power is the ability to order or accomplish a goal or to influence others, authority refers to a claim of legitimacy , the justification and right to exercise that power.
For example, while a mob may have the power to punish a criminal by beating or lynching , the rule of law indicates that only a court of law has the authority to determine and refer a criminal for punishment.
In this sense, authority is a matter of not only the ability or power to make decisions , but the right to make these decisions and execute them with commensurate power.
Appropriate authority is the basis of good government in the republican conception of government, which finds much of its theoretical origins in ancient Rome .
iPad ( EYE -pad ) is a line of tablet computers designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc.
, which run the iOS and iPadOS mobile operating systems.
The first iPad was released on April 3, 2010; the most recent iPad models are the sixth-generation iPad , released on March 27, 2018; the fifth-generation iPad mini , released on March 18, 2019; the third-generation iPad Air , released on March 18, 2019; and the 11-inch (280 mm) and third-generation 12.9-inch (330 mm) iPad Pro , released on November 7, 2018.
As of May 2017 , Apple has sold more than 360 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013.
It is the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2018.
The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard .
All iPads can connect via Wi-Fi ; some models also have cellular connectivity.
iPads can shoot video , take photos , play music , and perform Internet functions such as web-browsing and emailing.
Other functions – games , reference , GPS navigation , social networking , etc.
– can be enabled by downloading and installing apps .
As of March 2016 , the App Store has more than million apps for the iPad by Apple and third parties.
There have been nine versions of the iPad.
The first generation established design precedents, some of which have persisted through all models.
The 2nd-generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a dual-core Apple A5 processor, and VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling.
The third generation added a Retina Display , the new Apple A5X processor with a quad-core graphics processor , a 5- megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation , and 4G ( LTE ).
The fourth generation added the Apple A6X processor and replaced the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector .
The iPad Air added the Apple A7 processor and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness for the first time since the iPad 2.
The iPad Air 2 added the Apple A8X processor, the Apple M8 motion coprocessor , an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor ; and further reduced the thickness.
The iPad introduced in 2017 added the Apple A9 processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price.
In 2018, Apple released a 2018 model of iPad with Apple A10 Fusion processor and Apple Pencil support.
A year later, the 2019 iPad Air is released, with 10.5-inch display and Apple A12 chip.
There have been five versions of the iPad Mini , all of which have a screen size of 7.9 inches (20 cm).
The first generation has similar internal specifications to the iPad 2 but uses the Lightning connector instead.
The iPad Mini 2 added the Retina Display , the Apple A7 processor, and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor , closely matching the internal specifications of the iPad Air.
The iPad Mini 3 added the Touch ID fingerprint sensor.
The iPad Mini 4 features the Apple A8 and the Apple M8 motion coprocessor.
The 5th generation features the Apple A12 SoC.
There have been three generations of the iPad Pro .
The first generation came with 9.7 and 12.9 screen sizes, while the second came with 10.5 and 12.9 sizes, and the third with 11 and 12.9 sizes.
The iPad Pros have unique features such as the Smart Connector, which are exclusive to this series of iPads.
A mother is the female parent of a child .
Mothers are women who inhabit or perform the role of bearing some relation to their children , who may or may not be their biological offspring .
Thus, dependent on the context, women can be considered mothers by virtue of having given birth , by raising their child(ren), supplying their ovum for fertilisation , or some combination thereof.
Such conditions provide a way of delineating the concept of motherhood, or the state of being a mother.
Women who meet the third and first categories usually fall under the terms 'birth mother' or 'biological mother', regardless of whether the individual in question goes on to parent their child.
Accordingly, a woman who meets only the second condition may be considered an adoptive mother, and those who meet only the first or only the third a surrogacy mother.
An adoptive mother is a female who has become the child's parent through the legal process of adoption .
A biological mother is the female genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual intercourse or egg donation .
A biological mother may have legal obligations to a child not raised by her, such as an obligation of monetary support.
A putative mother is a female whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established.
A stepmother is a female who is the wife of a child's father and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child.
The above concepts defining the role of mother are neither exhaustive nor universal, as any definition of 'mother' may vary based on how social, cultural, and religious roles are defined.
The parallel conditions and terms for males: those who are (typically biologically) fathers do not, by definition, take up the role of fatherhood.
Motherhood and fatherhood are not limited to those who are or have parented .
Women who are pregnant may be referred to as expectant mothers or mothers-to-be, though such applications tend to be less readily applied to (biological) fathers or adoptive parents.
The process of becoming a mother has been referred to as matrescence.
The adjective maternal refers to a mother and comparatively to paternal for a father .
The verb to mother means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun mothering.
Related terms of endearment are mom ( mama , mommy ), mum , mumsy , mamacita ( ma , mam ) and mammy .
A female role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a mother-figure .
A fellow is a member of an academy , learned society or group of learned people (a fellowship ) which works together in pursuing mutual knowledge or practice.
There are many different kinds of fellowships which are awarded for different reasons in academia and industry.
These often indicate a different level of scholarship .
A startup or start up is a company initiated by individual founders or entrepreneurs to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.
Founders design startups to effectively develop and validate a scalable business model .
Hence, the concepts of startups and entrepreneurship are similar.
However, entrepreneurship refers all new businesses, including self-employment and businesses that never intend to grow big or become registered, while startups refer to new businesses that intend to grow beyond the solo founder, have employees, and intend to grow large.
Start ups face high uncertainty and do have high rates of failure, but the minority that go on to be successful companies have the potential to become large and influential.
Some startups become unicorns , i.e. privately held startup companies valued at over US$1 billion.
Luck is the phenomenon that defines the experience of notably positive, negative, or improbable events.
The naturalistic interpretation is that positive and negative events happen all the time in human lives, both due to random and non-random natural and artificial processes, and that even improbable events can happen by random chance .
In this view, being lucky or unlucky is simply a descriptive label that points out an event's positivity, negativity, or improbability.
Supernatural interpretations of luck consider it to be an attribute of a person or object, or the result of a favorable or unfavorable view of a deity upon a person.
These interpretations often prescribe how luckiness or unluckiness can be obtained, such as by carrying a lucky charm or making sacrifices or prayers to a deity.
Saying someone is born lucky then might mean, depending on the interpretation, anything from that they have been born into a good family or circumstance, or that they habitually experience improbably positive events due to some inherent property or the lifelong favor of a god or goddess in a monotheistic or polytheistic religion.
Many superstitions are related to luck, though these are often specific to a given culture or set of related cultures, and sometimes contradictory.
For example, lucky symbols include the number 7 in Christian-influenced cultures, but the number 8 in Chinese-influenced cultures.
Unlucky symbols and events include entering and leaving a house by different doors in Greek culture, throwing rocks into the wind in Navajo culture, and ravens in Western culture.
Some of these associations may derive from related facts or desires.
For example, in Western culture opening an umbrella indoors might be considered unlucky partly because it could poke someone in the eye, whereas shaking hands with a chimney sweep might be considered lucky partly because it is a kind but unpleasant thing to do given the dirty nature of their work.
In Chinese culture, the association of the number 4 as a homophone with the word for death may explain why it is considered unlucky.
Extremely complicated and sometimes contradictory systems for prescribing auspicious and inauspicious times and arrangements of things have been devised, for example feng shui in Chinese culture and systems of astrology in various cultures around the world.
Many polytheistic religions have specific gods or goddesses that are associated with luck, including Fortuna and Felicitas in the Ancient Roman religion (the former related to the words fortunate and unfortunate in English), Dedun in Nubian religion, the Seven Lucky Gods in Japanese mythology , mythical American serviceman John Frum in Polynesian cargo cults , and the inauspicious Alakshmi in Hinduism.
The minute is a unit of time or angle .
As a unit of time, the minute is most of times equal to ​ ⁄ 60 (the first sexagesimal fraction ) of an hour , or 60 seconds .
In the UTC time standard , a minute on rare occasions has 61 seconds, a consequence of leap seconds (there is a provision to insert a negative leap second, which would result in a 59-second minute, but this has never happened in more than 40 years under this system).
As a unit of angle, the minute of arc is equal to ​ ⁄ 60 of a degree , or 60 seconds (of arc) .
Although not an SI unit for either time or angle, the minute is accepted for use with SI units for both.
The SI symbols for minute or minutes are min for time measurement, and the prime symbol after a number, e.g. 5′, for angle measurement.
The prime is also sometimes used informally to denote minutes of time.
Biologically , an adult is a human or other organism that has reached sexual maturity .
In human context, the term adult additionally has meanings associated with social and legal concepts.
In contrast to a minor , a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent, self-sufficient , and responsible .
The typical age of attaining legal adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights and country.
Human adulthood encompasses psychological adult development .
Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority.
Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that may define an adult character.
In different cultures there are events that relate passing from being a child to becoming an adult or coming of age .
This often encompasses the passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood, or reaching a specified age, sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation.
Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood.
English usually refers to:
English may also refer to:
Rosa or De Rosa may refer to:
Plane or planes may refer to:
A father is the male parent of a child .
Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may have a parental, legal, and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations.
An adoptive father is a male who has become the child's parent through the legal process of adoption .
A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the infant , through sexual intercourse or sperm donation .
A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support.
A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established.
A stepfather is a male who is the husband of a child's mother and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child.
The adjective paternal refers to a father and comparatively to maternal for a mother .
The verb to father means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun fathering.
Biological fathers determine the sex of their child through a sperm cell which either contains an X chromosome (female), or Y chromosome (male).
Related terms of endearment are dad ( dada , daddy ), papa , pappa , papasita, ( pa , pap ) and pop .
A male role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a father-figure .
Deoxyribonucleic acid ( ( listen ) ; DNA ) is a molecule composed of two chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses .
DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids ; alongside proteins , lipids and complex carbohydrates ( polysaccharides ), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life .
The two DNA strands are also known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides .
Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases ( cytosine C, guanine G, adenine A or thymine T), a sugar called deoxyribose , and a phosphate group .
The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone .
The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA.
The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, pyrimidines and purines .
In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine.
Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information .
This information is replicated as and when the two strands separate.
A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding , meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences .
The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel .
Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, bases ).
It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information.
RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription .
Under the genetic code , these RNA strands specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation .
Within eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes .
Before typical cell division , these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication , providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell.
Eukaryotic organisms ( animals , plants , fungi and protists ) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus as nuclear DNA , and some in the mitochondria as mitochondrial DNA or in chloroplasts as chloroplast DNA .
In contrast, prokaryotes ( bacteria and archaea ) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm , in circular chromosomes .
Within eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins, such as histones , compact and organize DNA.
These compacting structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.
DNA was first isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869.
Its molecular structure was first identified by Francis Crick and James Watson at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling , who was a post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin .
DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity .
The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication.
Among notable advances in this field are DNA origami and DNA-based hybrid materials.
A tool is an object used to extend the ability of an individual to modify features of the surrounding environment.
Although many animals use simple tools , only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia , use tools to make other tools.
The set of tools needed to perform different tasks that are part of the same activity is called gear or equipment .
While one may apply the term tool loosely to many things that are means to an end (e.g., a fork ), strictly speaking an object is a tool only if, besides being constructed to be held, it is also made of a material that allows its user to apply to it various degrees of force.
If repeated use wears part of the tool down (like a knife blade), it may be possible to restore it; if it wears the tool out or breaks it, the tool must be replaced.
Thus tool falls under the taxonomic category implement , and is on the same taxonomic rank as instrument , utensil , device , or ware.
Solar may refer to:
A machine (or mechanical device ) is a mechanical structure that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action.
Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal , or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement.
They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems .
Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage .
Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use.
Examples include a wide range of vehicles , such as automobiles , boats and airplanes , appliances in the home and office, including computers, building air handling and water handling systems , as well as farm machinery , machine tools and factory automation systems and robots .
Turn may refer to:
Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence .
In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war ) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or heterogeneous (relatively foreign or distinct) groups .
Throughout history leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a certain type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties .
Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduction of conflicts, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.
The avoidance of war or violent hostility can be the result of thoughtful active listening and communication that enables greater genuine mutual understanding and therefore compromise.
Leaders often benefit tremendously from the prestige of peace talks and treaties that can result in substantially enhanced popularity.
“Psychological peace” (such as a peaceful thinking and emotions) is perhaps less well defined yet often a necessary precursor to establishing behavioral peace.
Peaceful behavior sometimes results from a peaceful inner disposition.
Some have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with a certain quality of inner tranquility that does not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life for its existence.
The acquisition of such a peaceful internal disposition for oneself and others can contribute to resolving of otherwise seemingly irreconcilable competing interests.
Because psychological peace can be important to Behavioral peace, leaders sometimes de-escalate conflicts through compliments and generosity.
Small gestures of rhetorical and actual generosity have been shown in psychological research to often result in larger levels of reciprocal generosity (and even virtuous circles of generosity).
Such benevolent selfless behavior can eventually become a pattern that may become a lasting basis for improved relations between individuals and groups of people.
Peace talks often start without preconditions and preconceived notions, because they are more than just negotiating opportunities.
They place attention on peace itself over and above what may have been previously perceived as the competing needs or interests of separate individuals or parties to elicit peaceful feelings and therefore produce benevolent behavioral results.
Peace talks are sometimes also uniquely important learning opportunities for the individuals or parties involved.
Sweetness is a basic taste most commonly perceived when eating foods rich in sugars .
Sweet tastes are generally regarded as pleasurable , except when in excess.
In addition to sugars like sucrose , many other chemical compounds are sweet, including aldehydes , ketones , and sugar alcohols .
Some are sweet at very low concentrations, allowing their use as non-caloric sugar substitutes .
Such non-sugar sweeteners include saccharin and aspartame .
Other compounds, such as miraculin , may alter perception of sweetness itself.
The perceived intensity of sugars and high-potency sweeteners, such as aspartame and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, are heritable, with gene effect accounting for approximately 30% of the variation.
The chemosensory basis for detecting sweetness, which varies between both individuals and species, has only begun to be understood since the late 20th century.
One theoretical model of sweetness is the multipoint attachment theory , which involves multiple binding sites between a sweetness receptor and a sweet substance.
Studies indicate that responsiveness to sugars and sweetness has very ancient evolutionary beginnings, being manifest as chemotaxis even in motile bacteria such as E.
Newborn human infants also demonstrate preferences for high sugar concentrations and prefer solutions that are sweeter than lactose , the sugar found in breast milk.
Sweetness appears to have the highest taste recognition threshold, being detectable at around 1 part in 200 of sucrose in solution.
By comparison, bitterness appears to have the lowest detection threshold, at about 1 part in 2 million for quinine in solution.
In the natural settings that human primate ancestors evolved in, sweetness intensity should indicate energy density , while bitterness tends to indicate toxicity .
The high sweetness detection threshold and low bitterness detection threshold would have predisposed our primate ancestors to seek out sweet-tasting (and energy-dense) foods and avoid bitter-tasting foods.
Even amongst leaf-eating primates, there is a tendency to prefer immature leaves, which tend to be higher in protein and lower in fibre and poisons than mature leaves.
The 'sweet tooth' thus has an ancient evolutionary heritage, and while food processing has changed consumption patterns, human physiology remains largely unchanged.
In colloquial language, an average is a single number taken as representative of a list of numbers.
Different concepts of average are used in different contexts.
Often average refers to the arithmetic mean , the sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers are being averaged.
In statistics, mean, median , and mode are all known as measures of central tendency , and in colloquial usage any of these might be called an average value .
Shores is a band from Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.
The band is often described as slowcore.
Shores began as a recording project between guitarist, vocalist and bass guitarist Brian Przybylski, and drummer John Massel in summer 2008.
After the completion of their second LP, To Volstead , guitarist Sean Stearns and bass guitarist Billy Bartholomew were added to the band.
Massel and Shores parted ways at the start of 2013.
Shores are most known for their frequent recording output, having released their first full-length LP, Coup de Grace at The Fest in October 2010, followed by three more records at The Fest 10 in October 2011.
A split 7 single with their label and tour mates Creepoid was released on record store day in 2012, followed by a third full-length LP, Leavening , the following summer, when, according to the band's official web site, a third guitarist, Patrick Boylan, also joined the band.
Tartu ( Estonian pronunciation: ˈtɑrtˑu , South Estonian : Tarto ) is the second largest city of Estonia , after Estonia's political and financial capital Tallinn .
Tartu is often considered the intellectual centre of the country, especially since it is home to the nation's oldest and most renowned university, the University of Tartu .
The city also houses the Supreme Court of Estonia , the Ministry of Education and Research , and the new building of the Estonian National Museum , opened to the public in October 2016.
It is also the birthplace of Estonian Song Festivals .
Situated 186 kilometres (116 miles) southeast of Tallinn and 245 kilometres (152 miles) northeast of Riga, Tartu lies on the Emajõgi (Mother river), which connects the two largest lakes of Estonia.
The city is served by Tartu Airport .
Vessel or vessels may refer to:
A battle is a combat in warfare between two or more armed forces .
A war usually consists of multiple battles.
Battles generally are well defined in duration, area, and force commitment.
A battle with only limited engagement between the forces and without decisive results is sometimes called a skirmish .
Wars and military campaigns are guided by strategy , whereas battles take place on a level of planning and execution known as operational mobility .
German strategist Carl von Clausewitz stated that the employment of battles ...
to achieve the object of war was the essence of strategy .
A house is a building that functions as a home .
They can range from simple dwellings such as rudimentary huts of nomadic tribes and the improvised shacks in shantytowns to complex, fixed structures of wood, brick, concrete or other materials containing plumbing, ventilation, and electrical systems.
Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space.
Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers.
Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms , a kitchen or cooking area, and a living room .
A house may have a separate dining room , or the eating area may be integrated into another room.
Some large houses in North America have a recreation room .
In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans.
The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household .
Most commonly, a household is a family unit of some kind, although households may also be other social groups , such as roommates or, in a rooming house , unconnected individuals.
Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure.
A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for vehicles or a shed for gardening equipment and tools.
A house may have a backyard or frontyard, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat.

Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands .
It is the largest country in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country by total area .
The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea , Indonesia , and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.
The population of 25 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.
Australia's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney .
The country's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide .
Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to European discovery with the arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century, who named it New Holland .
In 1770, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788, a date which became Australia's national day .
The population grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established.
On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia.
Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .
Being the oldest, flattest and driest inhabited continent, with the least fertile soils , Australia has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300 sq mi).
A megadiverse country , its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east and mountain ranges in the south-east.
Its population density , 2.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, remains among the lowest in the world.
Australia generates its income from various sources including mining-related exports , telecommunications , banking , and manufacturing .
Australia is a highly developed country , with the world's 14th-largest economy .
It has a high-income economy , with the world's tenth-highest per capita income .
It is a regional power and has the world's 13th-highest military expenditure .
Australia has the world's eighth-largest immigrant population , with immigrants accounting for 29% of the population.
Having the third-highest human development index and the eighth-highest ranked democracy globally, the country ranks highly in quality of life, health, education, economic freedom , civil liberties and political rights, with all its major cities faring well in global comparative livability surveys.
Australia is a member of the United Nations , G20 , Commonwealth of Nations , ANZUS , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization , Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , Pacific Islands Forum , and the ASEAN Plus Six mechanism .
Videotape is magnetic tape used for storing video and usually sound in addition.
Information stored can be in the form of either an analog signal or digital signal .
Videotape is used in both video tape recorders (VTRs) or, more commonly, videocassette recorders (VCRs) and camcorders .
Videotapes are also used for storing scientific or medical data, such as the data produced by an electrocardiogram .
Because video signals have a very high bandwidth , and stationary heads would require extremely high tape speeds, in most cases, a helical-scan video head rotates against the moving tape to record the data in two dimensions.
Tape is a linear method of storing information and thus imposes delays to access a portion of the tape that is not already under the heads.
The early 2000s saw the introduction and rise to prominence of high quality random-access video recording media such as hard disks and flash memory .
Since then, videotape has been increasingly relegated to archival and similar uses.
A university ( Latin : universitas , 'a whole') is an institution of higher (or tertiary ) education and research which awards academic degrees in various academic disciplines .
Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education .
The word university is derived from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium , which roughly means community of teachers and scholars.
The modern university system has roots in the European medieval university , which was created in Italy and evolved from cathedral schools for the clergy during the High Middle Ages .
The heart is a muscular organ in most animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system .
Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients , as well as assisting in the removal of metabolic wastes .
In humans, the heart is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest .
In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles .
Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart .
Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers.
In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves , which prevent backflow .
The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium , which also contains a small amount of fluid .
The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium , myocardium , and endocardium .
The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node .
These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart .
The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation , which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle.
From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation , through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide.
Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide .
The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute.
Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths.
Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke .
Risk factors include: smoking , being overweight , little exercise, high cholesterol , high blood pressure , and poorly controlled diabetes , among others.
Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath .
Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history , listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope , ECG , and ultrasound .
Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists , although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.
A doll is a model of a human, often used as a toy for children.
Dolls have traditionally been used in magic and religious rituals throughout the world, and traditional dolls made of materials such as clay and wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe.
The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt , Greece and Rome .
They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art .
Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, from the 15th century.
With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic , dolls were increasingly mass-produced.
During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles .
In architecture , a hall is a relatively large space enclosed by a roof and walls.
In the Iron Age and early Middle Ages in northern Europe, a mead hall was where a lord and his retainers ate and also slept.
Later in the Middle Ages , the great hall was the largest room in castles and large houses, and where the servants usually slept.
As more complex house plans developed, the hall remained a large room for dancing and large feasts, often still with servants sleeping there.
It was usually immediately inside the main door.
In modern British houses, an entrance hall next to the front door remains an indispensable feature, even if it is essentially merely a corridor.
Today, the (entrance) hall of a house is the space next to the front door or vestibule leading to the rooms directly and/or indirectly.
Where the hall inside the front door of a house is elongated, it may be called a passage , corridor (from Spanish corredor used in El Escorial and 100 years later in Castle Howard ) or hallway .
In linguistics , a word is the smallest element that can be uttered in isolation with objective or practical meaning .
This contrasts deeply with a morpheme , which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own.
A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect ), or several ( rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected ), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are -s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed ).A complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes ( rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed ), or more than one root in a compound ( black-board, sand-box ).
Words can be put together to build larger elements of language , such as phrases ( a red rock , put up with ), clauses ( I threw a rock ), and sentences ( He threw a rock too, but he missed ).
The term word may refer to a spoken word or to a written word, or sometimes to the abstract concept behind either.
Spoken words are made up of units of sound called phonemes , and written words of symbols called graphemes , such as the letters of the English alphabet.

Diagnosis is the identification of the nature and cause of a certain phenomenon.
Diagnosis is used in many different disciplines , with variations in the use of logic , analytics , and experience, to determine cause and effect .
In systems engineering and computer science , it is typically used to determine the causes of symptoms, mitigations, and solutions.
A chariot is a type of carriage driven by a charioteer, usually using horses to provide rapid motive power.
Chariots were used by armies as transport or mobile archery platforms, for hunting or for racing, and as a conveniently fast way to travel for many ancient people.
The word chariot comes from the Latin term carrus , a loanword from Gaulish .
A chariot of war or one used in military parades was called a car .
In ancient Rome and some other ancient Mediterranean civilizations , a biga required two horses, a triga three, and a quadriga four.
The chariot was a fast, light, open, two- wheeled conveyance drawn by two or more horses that were hitched side by side, and was little more than a floor with a waist-high guard at the front and sides.
It was initially used for ancient warfare during the Bronze and Iron Ages; but, after its military capabilities had been superseded by cavalry, as horses were gradually bred to be bigger, the chariot was used for travel , in processions , for games , and in races .
The critical invention that allowed the construction of light, horse-drawn chariots was the spoked wheel .
The earliest spoke-wheeled chariots date to ca.
The use of chariots peaked around 1300 BC (see Battle of Kadesh ).
Chariots had lost their military importance by the 1st century AD, but chariot races continued to be popular in Constantinople until the 6th century.
A wire is a single, usually cylindrical , flexible strand or rod of metal.
Wires are used to bear mechanical loads or electricity and telecommunications signals .
Wire is commonly formed by drawing the metal through a hole in a die or draw plate .
Wire gauges come in various standard sizes, as expressed in terms of a gauge number .
The term wire is also used more loosely to refer to a bundle of such strands, as in multistranded wire, which is more correctly termed a wire rope in mechanics, or a cable in electricity.
Wire comes in solid core, stranded, or braided forms.
Although usually circular in cross-section, wire can be made in square, hexagonal, flattened rectangular, or other cross-sections, either for decorative purposes, or for technical purposes such as high-efficiency voice coils in loudspeakers .
Edge-wound coil springs , such as the Slinky toy, are made of special flattened wire.
Diagnosis is the identification of the nature and cause of a certain phenomenon.
Diagnosis is used in many different disciplines , with variations in the use of logic , analytics , and experience, to determine cause and effect .
In systems engineering and computer science , it is typically used to determine the causes of symptoms, mitigations, and solutions.
California is a state in the Pacific Region of the United States .
With 39.6 million residents across a total area of about 163,696 square miles (423,970 km ), California is the most populous U.S. state and the third-largest by area.
The state capital is Sacramento .
The Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second- and fifth-most populous urban regions , with 18.7 million and 9.7 million residents respectively.
Los Angeles is California's most populous city , and the country's second-most populous , after New York City .
California also has the nation's most populous county , Los Angeles County , and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County .
The City and County of San Francisco is both the country's second-most densely populated major city after New York City and the fifth-most densely populated county , behind only four of the five New York City boroughs .
California's $3.0 trillion economy is larger than that of any other state; larger than those of Texas and Florida combined; and is the largest sub-national economy in the world.
If it were a country, California would be the fifth-largest economy in the world (larger than the United Kingdom , France , or India ), and the 36th-most populous as of 2017 .
The Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second- and third-largest urban economies ($1.253 trillion and $907 billion respectively as of 2017 ), after the New York metropolitan area .
The San Francisco Bay Area PSA had the nation's highest GDP per capita in 2017 (~$94,000) among large PSAs, and is home to three of the world's ten largest companies by market capitalization and four of the world's ten richest people.
California culture is considered a global trendsetter in popular culture , innovation , environmentalism , and politics .
As a result of the state's diversity and migration, California integrates foods, languages, and traditions from other areas across the country and around the globe.
It is considered the origin of the American film industry , the hippie counterculture, fast food , beach and car culture , the Internet , and the personal computer , among others.
The San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Los Angeles Area are widely seen as centers of the global technology and entertainment industries, respectively.
California has a very diverse economy: 58% of the state's economy is centered on finance , government , real estate services , technology , and professional, scientific, and technical business services .
Although it accounts for only 1.5% of the state's economy, California's agriculture industry has the highest output of any U.S. state.
California is bordered by Oregon to the north, Nevada and Arizona to the east, and the Mexican state of Baja California to the south (with the coast being on the west).
The state's diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in the east, and from the redwood – Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast.
The Central Valley , a major agricultural area, dominates the state's center.
Although California is well-known for its warm Mediterranean climate , the large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to arid desert in the interior, as well as snowy alpine in the mountains.
Over time, drought and wildfires have become more pervasive features.
What is now California was first settled by various Native Californian tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries.
The Spanish Empire then claimed it as part of Alta California , within its New Spain colony.
The area became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican–American War .
The western portion of Alta California was then organized and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850.
The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes, with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom.
In a building, a room is any space enclosed within four walls to which entry is possible only by a door that connects it either to a passageway , to another room, or to the outdoors, that is large enough for several persons to move about, and whose size, fixtures, furnishings, and sometimes placement within the building support the activity to be conducted in it.
A chemical substance is a form of matter having constant chemical composition and characteristic properties.
A chemical substance cannot be separated into its constituent elements by physical separation methods, i.e., without breaking chemical bonds .
Chemical substances can be simple substances , chemical compounds , or alloys .
Chemical elements may or may not be included in the definition, depending on expert viewpoint.
Chemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from mixtures .
A common example of a chemical substance is pure water ; it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory .
Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are diamond (carbon), gold , table salt ( sodium chloride ) and refined sugar ( sucrose ).
However, in practice, no substance is entirely pure, and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical.
Chemical substances exist as solids , liquids , gases , or plasma , and may change between these phases of matter with changes in temperature or pressure .
Chemical substances may be combined or converted to others by means of chemical reactions .
Forms of energy , such as light and heat , are not matter, and are thus not substances in this regard.
An amoeba ( ; rarely spelled amœba ; plural am(o)ebas or am(o)ebae ), often called amoeboid , is a type of cell or unicellular organism which has the ability to alter its shape, primarily by extending and retracting pseudopods .
Amoebas do not form a single taxonomic group ; instead, they are found in every major lineage of eukaryotic organisms.
Amoeboid cells occur not only among the protozoa , but also in fungi , algae , and animals .
Microbiologists often use the terms amoeboid and amoeba interchangeably for any organism that exhibits amoeboid movement .
In older classification systems, most amoebas were placed in the class or subphylum Sarcodina , a grouping of single-celled organisms that possess pseudopods or move by protoplasmic flow.
However, molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Sarcodina is not a monophyletic group whose members share common descent .
Consequently, amoeboid organisms are no longer classified together in one group.
The best known amoeboid protists are the giant amoebae Chaos carolinense and Amoeba proteus , both of which have been widely cultivated and studied in classrooms and laboratories.
Other well known species include the so-called brain-eating amoeba Naegleria fowleri , the intestinal parasite Entamoeba histolytica , which causes amoebic dysentery , and the multicellular social amoeba or slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum .
Kiev ( KEE -ef, -⁠ev ) or Kyiv ( Ukrainian : Київ , romanized : Kyiv ˈkɪjiu̯ ( listen ) ; Russian : Киев , romanized : Kiyev ˈkʲi(j)ɪf ) is the capital and most populous city of Ukraine , located in the north-central part of the country on the Dnieper .
The population in July 2015 was 2,887,974 (though higher estimated numbers have been cited in the press), making Kiev the 7th most populous city in Europe .
Kiev is an important industrial, scientific, educational and cultural center of Eastern Europe.
It is home to many high-tech industries, higher education institutions, and historical landmarks.
The city has an extensive system of public transport and infrastructure, including the Kiev Metro .
The city's name is said to derive from the name of Kyi , one of its four legendary founders.
During its history , Kiev, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of great prominence and relative obscurity.
The city probably existed as a commercial centre as early as the 5th century.
A Slavic settlement on the great trade route between Scandinavia and Constantinople , Kiev was a tributary of the Khazars , until its capture by the Varangians ( Vikings ) in the mid-9th century.
Under Varangian rule, the city became a capital of the Kievan Rus' , the first East Slavic state.
Completely destroyed during the Mongol invasions in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come.
It was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbours; first by Lithuania , followed by Poland and ultimately Russia .
The city prospered again during the Russian Empire 's Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century.
In 1918, after the Ukrainian National Republic declared independence from Soviet Russia , Kiev became its capital.
From 1921 onwards Kiev was a city of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic , which was proclaimed by the Red Army , and, from 1934, Kiev was its capital.
Following World War II , the city was almost completely ruined, but quickly recovered in the post-war years, remaining the third largest city of the Soviet Union .
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and Ukrainian independence in 1991, Kiev remained the capital of Ukraine and experienced a steady migration influx of ethnic Ukrainians from other regions of the country.
During the country's transformation to a market economy and electoral democracy , Kiev has continued to be Ukraine's largest and wealthiest city.
Kiev's armament-dependent industrial output fell after the Soviet collapse, adversely affecting science and technology.
But new sectors of the economy such as services and finance facilitated Kiev's growth in salaries and investment, as well as providing continuous funding for the development of housing and urban infrastructure.
Kiev emerged as the most pro-Western region of Ukraine where parties advocating tighter integration with the European Union dominate during elections .
Leland Stanford Junior University ( Stanford University or Stanford ) is a private research university in Stanford, California .
Stanford is known for its academic strength, wealth, selectivity, proximity to Silicon Valley , and ranking as one of the world's top universities.
The university was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr. , who had died of typhoid fever at age 15 the previous year.
Stanford was a U.S. Senator and former Governor of California who made his fortune as a railroad tycoon .
The school admitted its first students on October 1, 1891, as a coeducational and non-denominational institution.
Stanford University struggled financially after the death of Leland Stanford in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake .
Following World War II , Provost Frederick Terman supported faculty and graduates' entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what would later be known as Silicon Valley .
The university is also one of the top fundraising institutions in the country, becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.
The university is organized around three traditional schools consisting of 40 academic departments at the undergraduate and graduate level and four professional schools that focus on graduate programs in law, medicine, education and business.
Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference .
It has gained 123 NCAA team championships, the most for a university.
Stanford athletes have won 522 (the most) individual championships, and Stanford has won the NACDA Directors' Cup for 24 consecutive years, beginning in 1994–1995.
In addition, Stanford students and alumni have won 270 Olympic medals including 139 gold medals .
As of October 2018, 83 Nobel laureates , 27 Turing Award laureates , and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with Stanford as students, alumni, faculty or staff.
In addition, Stanford University is particularly noted for its entrepreneurship and is one of the most successful universities in attracting funding for start-ups .
Stanford alumni have founded a large number of companies , which combined produce more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue and have created 5.4 million jobs as of 2011, roughly equivalent to the 10th largest economy in the world (as of 2011 ).
Stanford is the alma mater of 30 living billionaires and 17 astronauts, and is also one of the leading producers of members of the United States Congress .
A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word , phrase , or other set of symbols ).
Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the sense of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes).
Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions , which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples.
A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.
In mathematics , a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, instead of describing a pre-existing term.
Definitions and axioms are the basis on which all of modern mathematics is constructed.
The arts refers to the theory and physical expression of creativity found in human societies and cultures .
Major constituents of the arts include literature (including drama , poetry , and prose ), performing arts (among them dance , music , and theatre ), and visual arts (including drawing , painting , filmmaking , architecture , ceramics , sculpting , and photography ).
Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g., cinematography ) or artwork with the written word (e.g., comics ).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films , art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying humankind's relationship with the environment.

Predation is a biological interaction where one organism, the predator , kills and eats another organism, its prey .
It is one of a family of common feeding behaviours that includes parasitism and micropredation (which usually do not kill the host ) and parasitoidism (which always does, eventually).
It is distinct from scavenging on dead prey, though many predators also scavenge; it overlaps with herbivory, as a seed predator is both a predator and a herbivore .
Predators may actively search for prey or sit and wait for it.
When prey is detected, the predator assesses whether to attack it.
This may involve ambush or pursuit predation , sometimes after stalking the prey.
If the attack is successful, the predator kills the prey, removes any inedible parts like the shell or spines, and eats it.
Predators are adapted and often highly specialized for hunting, with acute senses such as vision , hearing , or smell .
Many predatory animals , both vertebrate and invertebrate , have sharp claws or jaws to grip, kill, and cut up their prey.
Other adaptations include stealth and aggressive mimicry that improve hunting efficiency.
Predation has a powerful selective effect on prey, and the prey develop antipredator adaptations such as warning coloration , alarm calls and other signals , camouflage , mimicry of well-defended species, and defensive spines and chemicals.
Sometimes predator and prey find themselves in an evolutionary arms race , a cycle of adaptations and counter-adaptations.
Predation has been a major driver of evolution since at least the Cambrian period.
Kid , Kids , KIDS , and K.I.D.S. may refer to:
Citizenship is the status of a person recognized under the custom or law as being a legal member of a sovereign state or belonging to a nation .
A person may have multiple citizenships .
A person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be stateless , while one who lives on state borders whose territorial status is uncertain is a border-lander.
Nationality is often used as a synonym for citizenship in English – notably in international law – although the term is sometimes understood as denoting a person's membership of a nation (a large ethnic group ).
In some countries, e.g. the United States , the United Kingdom , nationality and citizenship can have different meanings (for more information, see Nationality versus citizenship ).
Trade involves the transfer of goods or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money .
A system or network that allows trade is called a market .
The first trade occurred when the farmer traded goods with the shepherd .
An early form of trade, barter , saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services.
Barter involves trading things without the use of money.
Later, one bartering party started to involve precious metals , which gained symbolic as well as practical importance.
Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money.
As a result, buying can be separated from selling , or earning .
The invention of money (and later credit , paper money and non-physical money ) greatly simplified and promoted trade.
Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade , while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade .
In one modern view, trade exists due to specialization and the division of labor , a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production, but use their output in trades for other products and needs.
Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage (perceived or real) in the production of some trade-able commodity —including production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere, or because different regions' sizes may encourage mass production .
In such circumstances, trade at market prices between locations can benefit both locations.
Retail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location (such as a department store , boutique or kiosk ), online or by mail , in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the purchaser.
Wholesale trade is defined as traffic in goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers , or to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services.
Direction may refer to:
A machine (or mechanical device ) is a mechanical structure that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action.
Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal , or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement.
They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems .
Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage .
Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use.
Examples include a wide range of vehicles , such as automobiles , boats and airplanes , appliances in the home and office, including computers, building air handling and water handling systems , as well as farm machinery , machine tools and factory automation systems and robots .
Rwanda ( ( listen ) ; Kinyarwanda : U Rwanda u.ɾɡwaː.nda ( listen ) ), officially the Republic of Rwanda ( Kinyarwanda : Repubulika y'u Rwanda ; Swahili : Jamhuri ya Rwanda ; French : République du Rwanda ), is a country in Central and East Africa and one of the smallest countries on the African mainland.
Located a few degrees south of the Equator , Rwanda is bordered by Uganda , Tanzania , Burundi , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
Rwanda is in the African Great Lakes region and is highly elevated; its geography is dominated by mountains in the west and savanna to the east, with numerous lakes throughout the country.
The climate is temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year.
The population is young and predominantly rural, with a density among the highest in Africa.
Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the Banyarwanda , although within this group there are three subgroups: the Hutu , Tutsi and Twa .
The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people and are often considered descendants of Rwanda's earliest inhabitants.
Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social castes within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations.
Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is Kinyarwanda , spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as additional official languages.
The sovereign state of Rwanda has a presidential system of government.
The president is Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who took office in 2000.
Rwanda today has low corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech.
The country has been governed by a strict administrative hierarchy since precolonial times; there are five provinces delineated by borders drawn in 2006.
Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament.
Hunter-gatherers settled the territory in the stone and iron ages , followed later by Bantu peoples .
The population coalesced first into clans and then into kingdoms.
The Kingdom of Rwanda dominated from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies.
Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa , followed by Belgium , which invaded in 1916 during World War I .
Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy.
The Hutu population revolted in 1959.
They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962.
A 1973 military coup saw a change of leadership, but pro-Hutu policy remained.
The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front launched a civil war in 1990.
The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, died together when their plane was shot down in April 1994.
Social tensions erupted in the 1994 genocide , in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu.
The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.
Rwanda's developing economy suffered heavily in wake of the 1994 genocide, but has since strengthened.
The economy is based mostly on subsistence agriculture .
Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export.
Tourism is a fast-growing sector and is now the country's leading foreign exchange earner.
Rwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely, and visitors pay high prices for gorilla tracking permits.
Music and dance are an integral part of Rwandan culture, particularly drums and the highly choreographed intore dance.
Traditional arts and crafts are produced throughout the country, including imigongo , a unique cow dung art.
Rwanda has been governed as a unitary presidential system with a bicameral parliament ruled by Rwandan Patriotic Front since 1994.
The country is member of the African Union , the United Nations , the Commonwealth of Nations , COMESA , OIF and the East African Community .
The given name Eric , Erich , Erik , or Erick is derived from the Old Norse name Eiríkr (or Eríkr in Eastern Old Norse due to monophthongization).
The first element, ei- is derived either from the older Proto-Norse *aina(z) , meaning one, alone, unique, as in the form Æinrikr explicitly, or from *aiwa(z) everlasting, eternity.
The second element -ríkr stems either from *ríks king, ruler (cf.
Gothic reiks ) or from the therefrom derived *ríkijaz kingly, powerful, rich, prince.
The name is thus usually taken to mean sole ruler, autocrat or eternal ruler, ever powerful.
The most common spelling in Scandinavia and the Netherlands is Erik.
In Norway , another form of the name (which has kept the Old Norse diphthong) Eirik is also commonly used.
In Finland, the form Erkki is also used.
The modern Icelandic version is Eiríkur, while the modern Faroese version is Eirikur.
Éric eʁik is used in French, and in Germany Eric , Erik and Erich are used.
Although the name was in use in Anglo-Saxon England, its use was reinforced by Scandinavian settlers arriving before the Norman conquest of England .
It was an uncommon name in England until the Middle Ages, when it gained popularity, and finally became a common name in the 19th century.
This was partly because of the publishing of the novel Eric, or, Little by Little by Frederic Farrar in 1858.
In Norway, Sweden and Finland , the name day for Erik and Eirik is 18 May, commemorating the death of Saint Eric IX of Sweden .
The feminine derivative is Erica or Erika.
Indian or Indians refers to people or things related to India , or to the indigenous people of the Americas, or Aboriginal Australians until the 19th century.
Scheme or schemer may refer to:
A daughter is a female offspring - a girl or woman in relation to her parents .
Daughterhood is the state of being someone's daughter.
The male counterpart is a son .
Analogously the name is used in several areas to show relations between groups or elements.
The word daughter also has several other connotations attached to it, one of these being used in reference to female descendancy or consanguinity .
It can also be used as a term of endearment coming from an elder.
In patriarchal societies, daughters often have different or lesser familial rights than sons.
A family may prefer to have sons rather than daughters and subject daughters to female infanticide .
In some societies it is the custom for a daughter to be 'sold' to her husband, who must pay a bride price .
The reverse of this custom, where the parents pay the husband a sum of money to compensate for the financial burden of the woman, is found in societies where women do not labour outside the home, and is referred to as dowry .
Conflict may refer to:
A cement is a binder , a substance used for construction that sets , hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together.
There are two main forms of cement: Geopolymer cement and Portland Cement .
Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel ( aggregate ) together.
Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel , produces concrete .
Cement is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water as the planet's most-consumed resource.
Cements used in construction are usually inorganic , often lime or calcium silicate based, and can be characterized as either hydraulic or non-hydraulic , depending on the ability of the cement to set in the presence of water (see hydraulic and non-hydraulic lime plaster ).
Non-hydraulic cement does not set in wet conditions or under water.
Rather, it sets as it dries and reacts with carbon dioxide in the air.
It is resistant to attack by chemicals after setting.
Hydraulic cements (e.g., Portland cement ) set and become adhesive due to a chemical reaction between the dry ingredients and water.
The chemical reaction results in mineral hydrates that are not very water-soluble and so are quite durable in water and safe from chemical attack.
This allows setting in wet conditions or under water and further protects the hardened material from chemical attack.
The chemical process for hydraulic cement found by ancient Romans used volcanic ash ( pozzolana ) with added lime (calcium oxide).
The word cement can be traced back to the Roman term opus caementicium , used to describe masonry resembling modern concrete that was made from crushed rock with burnt lime as binder.
The volcanic ash and pulverized brick supplements that were added to the burnt lime, to obtain a hydraulic binder , were later referred to as cementum , cimentum , cäment , and cement .
In modern times, organic polymers are sometimes used as cements in concrete.
Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality , rhythm , and a variety of vocal techniques.
A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist (in jazz and popular music ).
Singers perform music ( arias , recitatives , songs , etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments .
Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists.
Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band .
Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera , Indian music and religious music styles such as gospel , traditional music styles, world music , jazz , blues , gazal and popular music styles such as pop , rock , electronic dance music and filmi (film songs).
Singing can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised.
It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort or ritual, as part of music education or as a profession.
Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction and regular practice .
If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong.
Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre , such as classical or rock , although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre).
They usually take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers.
Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion , releasing heat , light , and various reaction products .
Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition.
Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen, O 2 , to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy (418 kJ per 32 g of O 2 ); the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here.
At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced.
The flame is the visible portion of the fire.
Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen.
If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma .
Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.
Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration , which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning .
Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe.
The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems.
The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination.
If fire removes protective vegetation , heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water .
Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil.
This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, which only slowly recovers as nitrogen is fixed from the atmosphere by lightning and by leguminous plants such as clover .
Fire has been used by humans in rituals , in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting , forging , incineration of waste, cremation , and as a weapon or mode of destruction.
A medication (also referred to as medicine , pharmaceutical drug , or simply drug ) is a drug used to diagnose , cure , treat , or prevent disease .
Drug therapy ( pharmacotherapy ) is an important part of the medical field and relies on the science of pharmacology for continual advancement and on pharmacy for appropriate management.
Drugs are classified in various ways.
One of the key divisions is by level of control , which distinguishes prescription drugs (those that a pharmacist dispenses only on the order of a physician , physician assistant , or qualified nurse ) from over-the-counter drugs (those that consumers can order for themselves).
Another key distinction is between traditional small-molecule drugs, usually derived from chemical synthesis , and biopharmaceuticals , which include recombinant proteins , vaccines , blood products used therapeutically (such as IVIG ), gene therapy , monoclonal antibodies and cell therapy (for instance, stem-cell therapies).
Other ways to classify medicines are by mode of action, route of administration , biological system affected, or therapeutic effects .
An elaborate and widely used classification system is the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC system).
The World Health Organization keeps a list of essential medicines .
Drug discovery and drug development are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by pharmaceutical companies , academic scientists, and governments.
As a result of this complex path from discovery to commercialization, partnering has become a standard practice for advancing drug candidates through development pipelines.
Governments generally regulate what drugs can be marketed, how drugs are marketed , and in some jurisdictions, drug pricing.
Controversies have arisen over drug pricing and disposal of used drugs.
Generally, a fishery is an entity engaged in raising or harvesting fish which is determined by some authority to be a fishery.
According to the FAO , a fishery is typically defined in terms of the people involved, species or type of fish, area of water or seabed, method of fishing, class of boats, purpose of the activities or a combination of the foregoing features.
The definition often includes a combination of fish and fishers in a region, the latter fishing for similar species with similar gear types.
A fishery may involve the capture of wild fish or raising fish through fish farming or aquaculture .
Directly or indirectly, the livelihood of over 500 million people in developing countries depends on fisheries and aquaculture.
Overfishing , including the taking of fish beyond sustainable levels , is reducing fish stocks and employment in many world regions.
A report by Prince Charles ' International Sustainability Unit, the New York-based Environmental Defence Fund and 50in10 published in July 2014 estimated global fisheries were adding $270 billion a year to global GDP, but by full implementation of sustainable fishing, that figure could rise by as much as $50 billion.
Pop is an onomatopoeic word for a small explosion or similar sound.

The Billboard charts tabulate the relative weekly popularity of songs and albums in the United States and elsewhere.
The results are published in Billboard magazine.
Billboard biz, the online extension of the Billboard charts, provides additional weekly charts.
There are also Year End charts.
The charts may be dedicated to specific genre such as R&B, country or rock, or they may cover all genres.
The charts can be ranked according to sales, streams or airplay, and for main song charts such as the Hot 100 song chart, all three pools of data are used to compile the charts.
For the Billboard 200 album chart, streams and track sales are included in addition to album sales .
The weekly sales and streams charts are monitored on a Friday-to-Thursday cycle since July 2015, previously it was on a Monday-to-Sunday cycle.
Radio airplay song charts however follows the Monday to Sunday cycle (previously Wednesday to Tuesday).
The charts are released each Tuesday with an issue date the following Saturday, four days later.
David ( Hebrew : דָּוִד ) is described in the Hebrew Bible as the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah after Saul and Ishbaal ( Ish-bosheth ).
In the biblical narrative , David is a young shepherd who gains fame first as a musician and later by killing the enemy champion Goliath .
He becomes a favorite of King Saul and a close friend of Saul's son Jonathan .
Worried that David is trying to take his throne, Saul turns on David.
After Saul and Jonathan are killed in battle, David is anointed as King.
David conquers Jerusalem , taking the Ark of the Covenant into the city, and establishing the kingdom founded by Saul.
As king, David commits adultery with Bathsheba , leading him to arrange the death of her husband Uriah the Hittite .
Because of this sin, God denies David the opportunity to build the temple, and his son Absalom tries to overthrow him.
David flees Jerusalem during Absalom's rebellion, but after Absalom's death he returns to the city to rule Israel.
Before his peaceful death, he chooses his son Solomon as successor.
He is honored in the prophetic literature as an ideal king and the forefather of a future Messiah , and many psalms are ascribed to him.
Historians of the Ancient Near East agree that David probably existed around 1000 BCE, but that there is little that can be said about him as a historical figure.
It was initially thought that there were no evidence outside of the Bible concerning David, but the Tel Dan Stele , an inscribed stone erected by a king of Damascus in the late 9th/early 8th centuries BCE to commemorate his victory over two enemy kings, contains the phrase Hebrew : ביתדוד ‎, bytdwd , consisting of the Hebrew words house and David, which most scholars translate as House (Dynasty) of David .
Ancient Near East historians generally doubt that the united monarchy as described in the Bible existed.
David is richly represented in post-biblical Jewish written and oral tradition, and is discussed in the New Testament .
Early Christians interpreted the life of Jesus in light of the references to the Messiah and to David; Jesus is described as being descended from David .
David is discussed in the Quran and figures in Islamic oral and written tradition as well.
The biblical character of David has inspired many interpretations in art and literature over centuries.
Structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system , or the object or system so organized.
Material structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms , minerals and chemicals .
Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form .
Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links , or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.
Lunch , the abbreviation for luncheon , is a meal eaten around midday .
During the 20th century , the meaning gradually narrowed to a small or mid-sized meal eaten midday.
Lunch is commonly the second meal of the day, after breakfast .
The meal varies in size depending on the culture, and significant variations exist in different areas of the world.
A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field .
This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials , such as iron , and attracts or repels other magnets.
A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetized and creates its own persistent magnetic field.
An everyday example is a refrigerator magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door.
Materials that can be magnetized, which are also the ones that are strongly attracted to a magnet, are called ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic ).
These include the elements iron , nickel and cobalt and their alloys, some alloys of rare-earth metals , and some naturally occurring minerals such as lodestone .
Although ferromagnetic (and ferrimagnetic) materials are the only ones attracted to a magnet strongly enough to be commonly considered magnetic, all other substances respond weakly to a magnetic field, by one of several other types of magnetism .
Ferromagnetic materials can be divided into magnetically soft materials like annealed iron , which can be magnetized but do not tend to stay magnetized, and magnetically hard materials, which do.
Permanent magnets are made from hard ferromagnetic materials such as alnico and ferrite that are subjected to special processing in a strong magnetic field during manufacture to align their internal microcrystalline structure, making them very hard to demagnetize.
To demagnetize a saturated magnet, a certain magnetic field must be applied, and this threshold depends on coercivity of the respective material.
Hard materials have high coercivity, whereas soft materials have low coercivity.
The overall strength of a magnet is measured by its magnetic moment or, alternatively, the total magnetic flux it produces.
The local strength of magnetism in a material is measured by its magnetization .
An electromagnet is made from a coil of wire that acts as a magnet when an electric current passes through it but stops being a magnet when the current stops.
Often, the coil is wrapped around a core of soft ferromagnetic material such as mild steel , which greatly enhances the magnetic field produced by the coil.
A curve is a geometrical object in mathematics.
Curve(s) may also refer to:
A home , or domicile , is a living space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for an individual, family , household or several families in a tribe .
It is often a house , apartment , or other building , or alternatively a mobile home , houseboat , yurt or any other portable shelter.
A principle of constitutional law in many countries, related to the right to privacy enshrined in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the inviolability of the home as an individual's place of shelter and refuge .
Homes typically provide areas and facilities for sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene.
Larger groups may live in a nursing home , children's home , convent or any similar institution.
A homestead also includes agricultural land and facilities for domesticated animals .
Where more secure dwellings are not available, people may live in the informal and sometimes illegal shacks found in slums and shanty towns .
More generally, home may be considered to be a geographic area, such as a town , village , suburb , city , or country .
Culture ( ) is the social behavior and norms found in human societies .
History (from Greek ἱστορία , historia , meaning 'inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation') is the past as it is described in written documents, and the study thereof.
Events occurring before written records are considered prehistory .
History is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events.
Scholars who write about history are called historians .
History also includes the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them.
Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing perspective on the problems of the present.
Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur ), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends , because they do not show the disinterested investigation required of the discipline of history.
Herodotus , a 5th-century BC Greek historian is often considered within the Western tradition to be the father of history, or by some the father of lies, and, along with his contemporary Thucydides , helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history.
Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing.
In East Asia, a state chronicle , the Spring and Autumn Annals , was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived.
Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today.
The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation.
Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies.
An artery (plural arteries ) (from Greek ἀρτηρία (artēria) , meaning 'windpipe, artery') is a blood vessel that takes blood away from the heart to all parts of the body (tissues, lungs, etc).
Most arteries carry oxygenated blood; the two exceptions are the pulmonary and the umbilical arteries , which carry deoxygenated blood to the organs that oxygenate it.
The effective arterial blood volume is that extracellular fluid which fills the arterial system.
The arteries are part of the circulatory system , which is responsible for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to all cells, as well as the removal of carbon dioxide and waste products, the maintenance of optimum blood pH , and the circulation of proteins and cells of the immune system .
In mathematics , a percentage is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100.
It is often denoted using the percent sign , %, or the abbreviations pct., pct; sometimes the abbreviation pc is also used.
A percentage is a dimensionless number (pure number).

Ali ibn Abi Talib ( Arabic : عَلِي ابْن أَبِي طَالِب ‎, romanized : ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib ; 13 September 601 – 29 January 661) was the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad , the last prophet of Islam .
He ruled as the fourth caliph from 656 to 661, but is regarded as the rightful immediate successor to Muhammad as an Imam by Shia Muslims.
Ali was born inside the sacred sanctuary of the Kaaba in Mecca , the holiest place in Islam, to Abu Talib and Fatimah bint Asad .
He was the first male who accepted Islam, and, according to some authors, the first Muslim.
Ali protected Muhammad from an early age and took part in almost all the battles fought by the nascent Muslim community.
After migrating to Medina , he married Muhammad's daughter Fatimah .
He was appointed caliph by Muhammad's companions in 656, after Caliph Uthman ibn Affan was assassinated.
Ali's reign saw civil wars and in 661, he was attacked and assassinated by a Kharijite while praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa , being martyred two days later.
Ali is important to both Shias and Sunnis , politically and spiritually.
The numerous biographical sources about Ali are often biased according to sectarian lines, but they agree that he was a pious Muslim, devoted to the cause of Islam and a just ruler in accordance with the Qur'an and the Sunnah .
While Sunnis consider Ali the fourth and final of the Rashidun (rightly guided) caliphs , Shia Muslims regard Ali as the first Imam after Muhammad due to their interpretation of the events at Ghadir Khumm .
Shia Muslims also believe that Ali and the other Shia Imams (all of whom are from the Ahl al-Bayt , Muhammad's household) are the rightful successors to Muhammad.
Ali has also received recognition from a variety of non-Muslim organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Organization for Human Rights, for his governance and social justice.
Concepts are defined as abstract ideas or general notions that occur in the mind, in speech, or in thought.
They are understood to be the fundamental building blocks of thoughts and beliefs .
They play an important role in all aspects of cognition .
As such, concepts are studied by several disciplines, such as linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, and these disciplines are interested in the logical and psychological structure of concepts, and how they are put together to form thoughts and sentences.
The study of concepts has served as an important flagship of an emerging interdisciplinary approach called cognitive science.
In contemporary philosophy , there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is:
Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed superordinate and lower levels termed subordinate.
Additionally, there is the basic or middle level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.
For example, a basic-level concept would be chair, with its superordinate, furniture, and its subordinate, easy chair.
A concept is instantiated (reified) by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other ideas .
Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the cognitive science disciplines of linguistics , psychology and, philosophy , where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts.
Concepts are used as formal tools or models in mathematics , computer science , databases and artificial intelligence where they are sometimes called classes , schema or categories .
In informal use the word concept often just means any idea .
A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life.
The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation .
About one-third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid.
This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or cold deserts.
Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.
Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces.
Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods.
Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded by the wind.
This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms .
Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface.
Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits.
The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes.
Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones.
These areas are known as desert pavements and little further erosion takes place.
Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water.
Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate.
There may be underground sources of water in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers .
Where these are found, oases can occur.
Plants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment.
Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, water-resistant cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory .
Some annual plants germinate , bloom and die in the course of a few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture.
Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive.
Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day.
They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine .
Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again during the rare rainfall.
They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.
People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia.
Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life.
The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of increased desertification .
Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation , and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source.
Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara Desert , and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods.
Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara.
Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts, and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy .
Penicillin ( PCN or pen ) is a group of antibiotics which include penicillin G ( intravenous use ), penicillin V (use by mouth), procaine penicillin , and benzathine penicillin ( intramuscular use ).
Penicillin antibiotics were among the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci .
They are still widely used today, though many types of bacteria have developed resistance following extensive use.
About 10% of people report that they are allergic to penicillin; however, up to 90% of this group may not actually be allergic.
Serious allergies only occur in about 0.03%.
Those who are allergic to penicillin are most often given cephalosporin C because of its functional groups.
All penicillins are β-lactam antibiotics , which are some of the most powerful and successful achievements in modern science.
Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming .
People began using it to treat infections in 1942.
There are several enhanced penicillin families which are effective against additional bacteria; these include the antistaphylococcal penicillins , aminopenicillins and the antipseudomonal penicillins .
They are derived from Penicillium fungi.
Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli.
The International Association for the Study of Pain 's widely used definition defines pain as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.
In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition.
Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future.
Most pain resolves once the noxious stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but it may persist despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body.
Sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease.
Pain is the most common reason for physician consultation in most developed countries.
It is a major symptom in many medical conditions, and can interfere with a person's quality of life and general functioning.
Simple pain medications are useful in 20% to 70% of cases.
Psychological factors such as social support , hypnotic suggestion, excitement, or distraction can significantly affect pain's intensity or unpleasantness.
In some debates regarding physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia , pain has been used as an argument to permit people who are terminally ill to end their lives.
Feeling is the nominalization of the verb to feel .
The word was first used in the English language to describe the physical sensation of touch through either experience or perception .
The word is also used to describe experiences other than the physical sensation of touch, such as a feeling of warmth and of sentience in general.
In Latin , sentire meant to feel, hear or smell.In psychology, the word is usually reserved for the conscious subjective experience of emotion.
Phenomenology and heterophenomenology are philosophical approaches that provide some basis for knowledge of feelings.
Many schools of psychotherapy depend on the therapist achieving some kind of understanding of the client's feelings, for which methodologies exist.
Perception of the physical world does not necessarily result in a universal reaction among receivers (see emotions ), but varies depending upon one's tendency to handle the situation, how the situation relates to the receiver's past experiences, and any number of other factors.
Feelings are also known as a state of consciousness, such as that resulting from emotions, sentiments or desires.
People buy products in hopes that the product will make them feel a certain way: either happy, excited or beautiful.
Or, they find the product useful in some way, even indirectly such as to support a charity or for altruistic economic reasons.
Some people buy beauty products in hopes of achieving a state of happiness or a sense of self beauty or as an act or expression of beauty.
Past events are used in our lives to form schemas in our minds, and based on those past experiences, we expect our lives to follow a certain script.
However, storytelling, commemoration and reservation of commemoration (the unwillingness to overtly impose remembrances), research and investigation, and many other activities can help settle uneasy feelings without scripting, without the ambivalence that feeling can only be handled by proxy, which is not always true.
A social psychologist, Daniel Gilbert , conducted a study on the influence of feelings on events alongside other researchers.
The results showed that when the participants predicted a positive feeling for an event, the higher the chances that they wanted to relive the event.
Predicted feelings were either short-lived or did not correlate to what the participant expected.
Morning is the period of time from sunrise to noon.
There are no exact times for when morning begins and ends (also true for evening and night ) because they can vary according to one's lifestyle and the hours of daylight at each time of year.
However, morning strictly ends at noon, which is when afternoon starts.
Not when McDonald's finishes serving breakfast.
Morning can be defined as starting from midnight to noon, or from sunrise (which varies throughout the year) to noon, or from when one wakes up to noon.
Morning precedes afternoon , evening , and night in the sequence of a day .
Originally, the term referred to sunrise.
A week is a time unit equal to seven days .
It is the standard time period used for cycles of rest days in most parts of the world, mostly alongside—although not strictly part of—the Gregorian calendar .
In many languages, the days of the week are named after classical planets or gods of a pantheon .
In English, the names are Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , Saturday and Sunday .
Such a week may be called a planetary week .
This is in contrast to the lunar week in the Bible in which the seven days are simply numbered with seventh day being kept as a sabbath day.
While e.g. the US, Canada, Japan and Australia consider Sunday as the first day of the week, and while the week begins with Saturday in much of the Middle East, the international ISO 8601 standard has Monday as the first day of the week.
The ISO standard includes the ISO week date system, a numbering system for weeks within a given year, where each week beginning on a Monday is associated with the year that contains that week's Thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend Friday–Sunday, week number one of the year will start after that).
ISO 8601 assigns numbers to the days of the week, running from 1 to 7 for Monday through to Sunday.
The term week is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days, such as the nundinal cycle of the ancient Roman calendar, the work week, or school week referring only to the days spent on those activities.
Awareness is the ability to directly know and perceive , to feel, or to be cognizant of events.
More broadly, it is the state of being conscious of something.
Another definition describes it as a state wherein a subject is aware of some information when that information is directly available to bring to bear in the direction of a wide range of behavioral processes .
The concept is often synonymous to consciousness and is also understood as being consciousness itself.
The states of awareness are also associated with the states of experience so that the structure represented in awareness is mirrored in the structure of experience.

African Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans ) are an ethnic group of Americans with total or partial ancestry from any of the black racial groups of Africa.
The term typically refers to descendants of enslaved black people who are from the United States.
African Americans constitute the third largest racial and ethnic group in the United States (after White Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans ).
Most African Americans are descendants of enslaved peoples within the boundaries of the present United States.
On average, African Americans are of West / Central African and European descent, and some also have Native American ancestry.
According to U.S. Census Bureau data, African immigrants generally do not self-identify as African American.
The overwhelming majority of African immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities (≈95%).
Immigrants from some Caribbean , Central American and South American nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term.
African-American history starts in the 16th century, with peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as slaves to Spanish America, and in the 17th century with West African slaves taken to English colonies in North America.
After the founding of the United States, black people continued to be enslaved , and the last four million black slaves were only liberated after the Civil War in 1865.
Due to notions of white supremacy , they were treated as second-class citizens .
The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited U.S. citizenship to whites only, and only white men of property could vote.
These circumstances were changed by Reconstruction , development of the black community , participation in the great military conflicts of the United States , the elimination of racial segregation , and the civil rights movement which sought political and social freedom.
In 2008, Barack Obama became the first African American to be elected President of the United States .
Way is a road , route , path or pathway, including long distance paths .
Way may refer to:
To imagine means to form new images and sensations that are not perceived through the five physical senses.
Imagine may refer to:
Venture may refer to:
AL , Al or al may stand for:
A road is a thoroughfare , route, or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some form of conveyance , including a motor vehicle , cart, bicycle, or horse.
Roads consist of one or two roadways ( British English : carriageways), each with one or more lanes and any associated sidewalks (British English: pavement) and road verges .
There is sometimes a bike path .
Other names for roads include parkways, avenues, freeways, tollways, interstates, highways, or primary, secondary, and tertiary local roads.
A machine (or mechanical device ) is a mechanical structure that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action.
Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal , or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement.
They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems .
Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage .
Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use.
Examples include a wide range of vehicles , such as automobiles , boats and airplanes , appliances in the home and office, including computers, building air handling and water handling systems , as well as farm machinery , machine tools and factory automation systems and robots .
A cocktail is an alcoholic mixed drink , which is either a combination of spirits , or one or more spirits mixed with other ingredients such as fruit juice, flavored syrup, or cream.
There are various types of cocktails, based on the number and kind of ingredients added.
The origins of the cocktail are debated.
Symptomatology redirects here.
This subject requires a separate article.
A symptom (from Greek σύμπτωμα, accident, misfortune, that which befalls, from συμπίπτω, I befall, from συν- together, with and πίπτω, I fall) is a departure from normal function or feeling which is apparent to a patient , reflecting the presence of an unusual state, or of a disease .
A symptom can be subjective or objective.
Tiredness is a subjective symptom whereas cough or fever are objective symptoms.
In contrast to a symptom, a sign is a clue to a disease elicited by an examiner or a doctor.
For example, paresthesia is a symptom (only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling), whereas erythema is a sign (anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual).
Symptoms and signs are often nonspecific , but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses , helping to narrow down what may be wrong.
In other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic .
The term is sometimes also applied to physiological states outside the context of disease , as for example when referring to symptoms of pregnancy .
Many people use the term sign and symptom interchangeably.
Poverty is not having enough material possessions or income for a person's needs.
Poverty is a multifaceted concept, which may include social , economic , and political elements.
Absolute poverty is the complete lack of the means necessary to meet basic personal needs, such as food , clothing and shelter .
The threshold at which absolute poverty is defined is always about the same, independent of the person's permanent location or era.
On the other hand, relative poverty occurs when a person cannot meet a minimum level of living standards , compared to others in the same time and place.
Therefore, the threshold at which relative poverty is defined varies from one country to another, or from one society to another.
For example, a person who cannot afford housing better than a small tent in an open field would be said to live in relative poverty if almost everyone else in that area lives in modern brick homes, but not if everyone else also lives in small tents in open fields (for example, in a nomadic tribe ).
Governments and non-governmental organizations try to reduce poverty.
Providing basic needs to people who are unable to earn a sufficient income can be hampered by constraints on government's ability to deliver services, such as corruption , tax avoidance , debt and loan conditionalities and by the brain drain of health care and educational professionals.
Strategies of increasing income to make basic needs more affordable typically include welfare , economic freedoms and providing financial services.
Poverty reduction is still a major issue (or a target) for many international organizations such as the United Nations , the World Bank , United States Agency for International Development , Oxfam , CARE , World Vision International , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , and the Red Cross among a plethora of others.
A plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an objective to do something.
It is commonly understood as a temporal set of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a goal .
For spatial or planar topologic or topographic sets see map .
Plans can be formal or informal:
The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another.
For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories.
It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use.
More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space.
This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.
An elevator ( US and Canada ) or lift ( UK , Ireland and Australia ) is a type of vertical transportation device that moves people or goods between floors (levels, decks ) of a building, vessel , or other structure.
Elevators are typically powered by electric motors that drive traction cables and counterweight systems like a hoist , although some pump hydraulic fluid to raise a cylindrical piston like a jack .
In agriculture and manufacturing, an elevator is any type of conveyor device used to lift materials in a continuous stream into bins or silos .
Several types exist, such as the chain and bucket elevator , grain auger screw conveyor using the principle of Archimedes' screw , or the chain and paddles or forks of hay elevators .
Languages other than English may have loanwords based on either elevator or lift .
Because of wheelchair access laws, elevators are often a legal requirement in new multistory buildings, especially where wheelchair ramps would be impractical.
There are also some elevators which can go sideways in addition to the usual up-and-down motion.
Pretty may refer to:
A sidewalk ( American English ) or pavement ( British English ), also known as a footpath or footway , is a path along the side of a road .
A sidewalk may accommodate moderate changes in grade (height) and is normally separated from the vehicular section by a curb .
There may also be a median strip or road verge (a strip of vegetation, grass or bushes or trees or a combination of these) either between the sidewalk and the roadway or between the sidewalk and the boundary.
In some places, the same term may also be used for a paved path, trail or footpath that is not next to a road, for example, a path through a park .
A mobile phone , cell phone , cellphone , or hand phone , sometimes shortened to simply mobile , cell or just phone , is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area.
The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator , which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture, and, therefore, mobile telephones are called cellular telephones or cell phones , in North America.
In addition to telephony , 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services , such as text messaging , MMS , email , Internet access , short-range wireless communications ( infrared , Bluetooth ), business applications, video games , and digital photography .
Mobile phones offering only those capabilities are known as feature phones ; mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones .
The first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated by John F.
Mitchell and Martin Cooper of Motorola in 1973, using a handset weighing c.
2 kilograms (4.4 lbs).
In 1979, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) launched the world's first cellular network in Japan.
In 1983, the DynaTAC 8000x was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone.
From 1983 to 2014, worldwide mobile phone subscriptions grew to over seven billion—enough to provide one for every person on Earth.
In first quarter of 2016, the top smartphone developers worldwide were Samsung , Apple , and Huawei , and smartphone sales represented 78 percent of total mobile phone sales.
For feature phones (or dumbphones) as of 2016 , the largest were Samsung, Nokia , and Alcatel .
A suburb is a mixed-use or residential area , existing either as part of a city or urban area or as a separate residential community within commuting distance of a city.
In most English-speaking countries , suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner-city areas, but in Australian English and South African English , suburb has become largely synonymous with what is called a neighborhood in other countries and the term extends to inner-city areas.
In some areas, such as Australia , India , China , New Zealand , the United Kingdom , and parts of the United States and Canada , new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities.
In others, such as Saudi Arabia , France , and much of the United States and Canada, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county .
In the United States, beyond the suburbs are exurbs , or exurban areas, with less density but linked to the metropolitan area economically and by commuters.
Suburbs first emerged on a large scale in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of improved rail and road transport, which led to an increase in commuting.
In general, they have lower population densities than inner city neighborhoods within a metropolitan area, and most residents commute to central cities or other business districts ; however, there are many exceptions, including industrial suburbs , planned communities , and satellite cities .
Suburbs tend to proliferate around cities that have an abundance of adjacent flat land.
A neuron , also known as a neurone ( British spelling ) or nerve cell , is an electrically excitable cell that communicates with other cells via specialized connections called synapses .
It is the main component of nervous tissue .
All animals except sponges and placozoans have neurons, but other multicellular organisms such as plants do not.
Neurons are typically classified into three types based on their function.
Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch, sound, or light that affect the cells of the sensory organs , and they send signals to the spinal cord or brain.
Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions to glandular output .
Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord.
A group of connected neurons is called a neural circuit .
A typical neuron consists of a cell body ( soma ), dendrites , and a single axon .
The soma is usually compact.
The axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it.
Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few hundred micrometers from the soma.
The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock , and travels for as far as 1 meter in humans or more in other species.
It branches but usually maintains a constant diameter.
At the farthest tip of the axon's branches are axon terminals , where the neuron can transmit a signal across the synapse to another cell.
Neurons may lack dendrites or have no axon.
The term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon , particularly when the cell is undifferentiated .
Most neurons receive signals via the dendrites and soma and send out signals down the axon.
At the majority of synapses, signals cross from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another.
However, synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite.
The signaling process is partly electrical and partly chemical.
Neurons are electrically excitable, due to maintenance of voltage gradients across their membranes .
If the voltage changes by a large enough amount over a short interval, the neuron generates an all-or-nothing electrochemical pulse called an action potential .
This potential travels rapidly along the axon, and activates synaptic connections as it reaches them.
Synaptic signals may be excitatory or inhibitory , increasing or reducing the net voltage that reaches the soma.
In most cases, neurons are generated by neural stem cells during brain development and childhood.
Neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain.
However, strong evidence supports generation of substantial numbers of new neurons in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb .
Loving may refer to:
A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype , product or process .
The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design.
In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity.
A design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints , may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment .
Major examples of designs include architectural blueprints , engineering drawings , business processes , circuit diagrams , and sewing patterns .
The person who produces a design is a designer , which is a term generally used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas - usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a textile designer , fashion designer , product designer , concept designer , web designer ( website designer ) or interior designer ), but also others such as architects and engineers.
A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process, possibly using design methods .
The process of creating a design can be brief (a quick sketch) or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research, negotiation, reflection, modelling , interactive adjustment and re-design.
Soup is a primarily liquid food , generally served warm or hot (but may be cool or cold), that is made by combining ingredients of meat or vegetables with stock , or water.
Hot soups are additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted, forming a broth .
Soups are similar to stews , and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two; however, soups generally have more liquid (broth) than stews.
In traditional French cuisine, soups are classified into two main groups: clear soups and thick soups .
The established French classifications of clear soups are bouillon and consommé .
Thick soups are classified depending upon the type of thickening agent used: purées are vegetable soups thickened with starch ; bisques are made from puréed shellfish or vegetables thickened with cream ; cream soups may be thickened with béchamel sauce ; and veloutés are thickened with eggs , butter , and cream.
Other ingredients commonly used to thicken soups and broths include egg, rice , lentils , flour , and grains ; many popular soups also include pumpkin, carrots, potatoes, pig's trotters and bird's nests.
Other types of soup include fruit soups , dessert soups, pulse soups like split pea, cold soups and other styles.
Forth or FORTH may refer to:
A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity .
The nearest star to Earth is the Sun .
Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth.
Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms , the brightest of which gained proper names.
Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations .
However, most of the estimated 300 sextillion ( 3 × 10 ) stars in the observable universe are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all stars outside our galaxy , the Milky Way .
For at least a portion of its life, a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space .
Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes.
Near the end of its life, a star can also contain degenerate matter .
Astronomers can determine the mass , age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity , and spectrum respectively.
The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate.
Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement.
A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram).
Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.
A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements.
When the stellar core is sufficiently dense, hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through nuclear fusion, releasing energy in the process.
The remainder of the star's interior carries energy away from the core through a combination of radiative and convective heat transfer processes.
The star's internal pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity.
A star with mass greater than 0.4 times the Sun's will expand to become a red giant when the hydrogen fuel in its core is exhausted.
In some cases, it will fuse heavier elements at the core or in shells around the core.
As the star expands it throws a part of its mass, enriched with those heavier elements, into the interstellar environment, to be recycled later as new stars.
Meanwhile, the core becomes a stellar remnant : a white dwarf , a neutron star , or, if it is sufficiently massive, a black hole .
Binary and multi-star systems consist of two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and generally move around each other in stable orbits .
When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their evolution.
Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.
In modern medicine , a surgeon is a physician who performs surgical operations .
There are also surgeons in podiatry , dentistry maxillofacial surgeon and the veterinary fields.
A group is a number of people or things that are located, gathered, or classed together.
A month is a unit of time , used with calendars , which is approximately as long as a natural period related to the motion of the Moon ; month and Moon are cognates .
The traditional concept arose with the cycle of Moon phases ; such months ( lunations ) are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days .
From excavated tally sticks , researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age.
Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth-Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year .
An office is generally a room or other area where an organization's employees perform administrative work in order to support and realize objects and goals of the organization.
The word office may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it (see officer , office-holder , official ); the latter is in fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one's duty.
When used as an adjective , the term office may refer to business -related tasks.
In law , a company or organization has offices in any place where it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of (for example) a storage silo rather than an establishment with desk -and- chair .
An office is also an architectural and design phenomenon: ranging from a small office such as a bench in the corner of a small business of extremely small size (see small office/home office ), through entire floors of buildings, up to and including massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company.
In modern terms an office is usually the location where white-collar workers carry out their functions.
As per James Stephenson , Office is that part of business enterprise which is devoted to the direction and co-ordination of its various activities.
Offices in classical antiquity were often part of a palace complex or of a large temple.
The High Middle Ages (1000–1300) saw the rise of the medieval chancery , which was usually the place where most government letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of a kingdom.
With the growth of large, complex organizations in the 18th century, the first purpose-built office spaces were constructed.
As the Industrial Revolution intensified in the 18th and 19th centuries, the industries of banking , rail , insurance , retail , petroleum , and telegraphy grew dramatically, requiring a large number of clerks, and as a result more office space was assigned to house their activities.
The time-and-motion study , pioneered in manufacturing by F.
Taylor (1856-1915) led to the Modern Efficiency Desk of 1915 with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers.
However, by the middle of the 20th century, it became apparent that an efficient office required discretion in the control of privacy , and gradually the cubicle system evolved.
The main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their jobs.
Work spaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing and computer work.
There are nine generic types of work space, each supporting different activities.
In addition to individual cubicles, one can find meeting rooms , lounges , and spaces for support activities, such as photocopying and filing.
Some offices also have a kitchen area where workers can make their lunches.
There are many different ways of arranging the space in an office and whilst these vary according to function, managerial fashions and the culture of specific companies can be even more important.
While offices can be built in almost any location and in almost any building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult, such as requirements for light, networking, and security.
The major purpose of an office building is to provide a workplace and working environment - primarily for administrative and managerial workers.
These workers usually occupy set areas within the office building, and usually are provided with desks, PCs and other equipment they may need within these areas.
Optimism is a mental attitude reflecting a belief or hope that the outcome of some specific endeavor, or outcomes in general, will be positive, favorable, and desirable.
A common idiom used to illustrate optimism versus pessimism is a glass filled with water to the halfway point : an optimist is said to see the glass as half full, while a pessimist sees the glass as half empty.
The term derives from the Latin optimum , meaning best.
Being optimistic, in the typical sense of the word, is defined as expecting the best possible outcome from any given situation.
This is usually referred to in psychology as dispositional optimism.
It thus reflects a belief that future conditions will work out for the best.
For this reason, it is seen as a trait that fosters resilience in the face of stress .
Theories of optimism include dispositional models, and models of explanatory style .
Methods to measure optimism have been developed within both theoretical systems, such as various forms of the Life Orientation Test, for the original definition of optimism, or the Attributional Style Questionnaire designed to test optimism in terms of explanatory style.
Variation in optimism and pessimism is somewhat heritable and reflects biological trait systems to some degree.
It is also influenced by environmental factors , including family environment, with some suggesting it can be learned.
Optimism may also be linked to health .
Sufism , or Taṣawwuf ( Arabic : الْتَّصَوُّف ‎), variously defined as Islamic mysticism , the inward dimension of Islam or the phenomenon of mysticism within Islam, is mysticism in Islam, characterized ...
by particular values, ritual practices, doctrines and institutions which began very early in Islamic history and represents the main manifestation and the most important and central crystallization of mystical practice in Islam.
Practitioners of Sufism have been referred to as Sufis (from صُوفِيّ ‎ ṣūfiyy / ṣūfī ).
Historically, Sufis have often belonged to different ṭuruq or orders – congregations formed around a grand master referred to as a wali who traces a direct chain of successive teachers back to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad .
These orders meet for spiritual sessions ( majalis ) in meeting places known as zawiyas , khanqahs or tekke .
They strive for ihsan (perfection of worship), as detailed in a hadith : Ihsan is to worship Allah as if you see Him; if you can't see Him, surely He sees you.
Sufis regard Muhammad as al-Insān al-Kāmil , the primary perfect man who exemplifies the morality of God, and see him as their leader and prime spiritual guide.
All Sufi orders trace most of their original precepts from Muhammad through his cousin and son-in-law Ali , with the notable exception of one.
Although the overwhelming majority of Sufis, both pre-modern and modern, were and are adherents of Sunni Islam , there also developed certain strands of Sufi practice within the ambit of Shia Islam during the late medieval period, particularly after the forced conversion of Iran from majority Sunni to Shia .
Traditional Sufi orders during the first five centuries of Islam were all based in Sunni Islam .
Although Sufis were opposed to dry legalism, they strictly observed Islamic law and belonged to various schools of Islamic jurisprudence and theology.
Sufis have been characterized by their asceticism , especially by their attachment to dhikr , the practice of remembrance of God, often performed after prayers.
They gained adherents among a number of Muslims as a reaction against the worldliness of the early Umayyad Caliphate (661–750) and have spanned several continents and cultures over a millennium, initially expressing their beliefs in Arabic and later expanding into Persian , Turkish , and Urdu , among others.
Sufis played an important role in the formation of Muslim societies through their missionary and educational activities.
According to William Chittick , In a broad sense, Sufism can be described as the interiorization, and intensification of Islamic faith and practice.
Despite a relative decline of Sufi orders in the modern era and criticism of some aspects of Sufism by modernist thinkers and conservative Salafists , Sufism has continued to play an important role in the Islamic world, and has also influenced various forms of spirituality in the West.
Photography is the art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation , either electronically by means of an image sensor , or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film .
It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography ), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.
Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure .
With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel , which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing.
The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image , which is later chemically developed into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing .
A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print , either by using an enlarger or by contact printing .
Commonly, cousin refers to a first cousin, people whose most recent common ancestor is a grandparent.
A first cousin used to be known as a cousin-german , though this term is rarely used today.
More generally, cousin is a type of familial relationship in which people with a known common ancestor are both two or more generations away from their most recent common ancestor.
This distinguishes a cousin from an ancestor, descendant, sibling, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew.
Systems of degrees and removals are used in the English-speaking world to describe the exact relationship between two cousins (in the broad sense) and the ancestor they have in common.
Various governmental entities have established systems for legal use that can precisely specify kinship with common ancestors any number of generations in the past.
Common usage often eliminates the degrees and removals, and refers to people with common ancestry as simply distant cousins or relatives.
A globe is a spherical model of Earth , of some other celestial body , or of the celestial sphere .
Globes serve similar purposes to maps , but unlike maps, do not distort the surface that they portray except to scale it down.
A globe of Earth is called a terrestrial globe .
A globe of the celestial sphere is called a celestial globe .
A globe shows details of its subject.
A terrestrial globe shows land masses and water bodies.
It might show nations and prominent cities and the network of latitude and longitude lines.
Some have raised relief to show mountains.
A celestial globe shows stars, and may also show positions of other prominent astronomical objects.
Typically it will also divide the celestial sphere up into constellations.
The word globe comes from the Latin word globus , meaning sphere .
Globes have a long history.
The first known mention of a globe is from Strabo , describing the Globe of Crates from about 150 BC.
The oldest surviving terrestrial globe is the Erdapfel , wrought by Martin Behaim in 1492.
The oldest surviving celestial globe sits atop the Farnese Atlas , carved in the 2nd century Roman Empire .
In a building, a room is any space enclosed within four walls to which entry is possible only by a door that connects it either to a passageway , to another room, or to the outdoors, that is large enough for several persons to move about, and whose size, fixtures, furnishings, and sometimes placement within the building support the activity to be conducted in it.
Stocks are restraining devices that were used as a form of corporal punishment and public humiliation .
Attention is the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether deemed subjective or objective, while ignoring other perceivable information.
It is a state of arousal .
It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneous objects or trains of thought.
Focalization , the concentration of consciousness , is of its essence.
Attention has also been described as the allocation of limited cognitive processing resources.
Attention remains a major area of investigation within education , psychology , neuroscience , cognitive neuroscience , and neuropsychology .
Areas of active investigation involve determining the source of the sensory cues and signals that generate attention, the effects of these sensory cues and signals on the tuning properties of sensory neurons , and the relationship between attention and other behavioral and cognitive processes like working memory and psychological vigilance .
A relatively new body of research, which expands upon earlier research within psychopathology, is investigating the diagnostic symptoms associated with traumatic brain injury and its effects on attention.
Attention also varies across cultures.
The relationships between attention and consciousness are complex enough that they have warranted perennial philosophical exploration.
Such exploration is both ancient and continually relevant, as it can have effects in fields ranging from mental health and the study of disorders of consciousness to artificial intelligence and its domains of research
Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection and to the simplest pleasure .
An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love of food.
Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional attachment .
Love is also considered to be a virtue representing human kindness , compassion , and affection, as the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another.
It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animals.
Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts .
Love has been postulated to be a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species .
Ancient Greek philosophers identified five forms of love : essentially, familial love (in Greek , Storge ), friendly love or platonic love ( Philia ), romantic love ( Eros ), guest love ( Xenia ) and divine love ( Agape ).
Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love , empty love , companionate love , consummate love , infatuated love , self-love , and courtly love .
Asian cultures have also distinguished Ren , Kama , Bhakti , Mettā , Ishq , Chesed , and other variants or symbioses of these states .
The triangular theory of love suggests intimacy, passion and commitment are core components of love.
Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning.
This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states.

A lie is an assertion that is believed to be false, typically used with the purpose of deceiving someone.
The practice of communicating lies is called lying , and a person who communicates a lie may be termed a liar .
Lies may serve a variety of instrumental, interpersonal, or psychological functions for the individuals who use them.
Generally, the term lie carries a negative connotation, and depending on the context a person who communicates a lie may be subject to social, legal, religious, or criminal sanctions.
A woman is a female human being.
The word woman is usually reserved for an adult ; girl is the usual term for a female child or adolescent .
The plural women is also sometimes used for female humans, regardless of age, as in phrases such as women's rights .
Typically, a woman has two X chromosomes and is capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause .
Female anatomy, as distinguished from male anatomy, includes the fallopian tubes , ovaries , uterus , vulva , breasts , Skene's glands , and Bartholin's glands .
The female pelvis is wider than the male, the hips are generally broader, and women have significantly less facial and other body hair.
On average, women are shorter than men.
Throughout human history , traditional gender roles have often defined and limited women's activities and opportunities; many religious doctrines stipulate certain rules for women.
With restrictions loosening during the 20th century, women in many societies have access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker and are free to pursue higher education.
Violence against women , whether within families or in communities, has a long history, and is primarily committed by men.
Some women are denied reproductive rights .
The movements and ideologies of feminism have a shared goal of achieving gender equality .
Some women are trans (those who have a male sex assignment that does not align with their gender identity ), or intersex (those born with sexual characteristics that do not fit typical notions of male or female).
The thorax or chest is a part of the anatomy of humans and various other animals located between the neck and the abdomen .
The thorax includes the thoracic cavity and the thoracic wall .
It contains organs including the heart , lungs , and thymus gland, as well as muscles and various other internal structures.
Many diseases may affect the chest, and one of the most common symptoms is chest pain .
The word thorax comes from the Greek θώραξ thorax breastplate , cuirass , corslet via Latin : thorax .

Leadership is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or organization to lead or guide other individuals, teams , or entire organizations .
Specialist literature debates various viewpoints, contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) United States versus European approaches.
U.S. academic environments define leadership as a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task .
Studies of leadership have produced theories involving traits , situational interaction, function, behavior, power , vision and values , charisma , and intelligence, among others.
The Neoscopelidae ( blackchins or neoscopelids ) are a small family of deep-sea fish closely related to the lanternfish .
They are found in tropical and subtropical marine waters worldwide.
They can be distinguished from the lanternfish only by a few technical characters, such as the position of the anal fin being far behind that of the dorsal fin .
Some species also lack the light-emitting organs ( photophores ) of the lanternfish.
They are typically between 20 and 30 cm (7.9 and 11.8 in) in length.
One genus has photophores arranged in a single series along the edge of the tongue and one or two along the ventral surface of the body.
Neoscopelidae is also known as Blackhins.
They are composed of three genera, Neoscopelus, Scopelengys and the monotypic Solivomer (Philippines), the Neoscopelidae is a small assemblage of poorly known deep-sea pelagic and benthopelagic fishes.
Little is known of the biology of the neoscopelids, and perhaps the most noteworthy thing about them is their generalized anatomy.
They contain photophores which are arranged in a single series along the periphery of the tongue, and in a mid-ventral and several bilateral series along the trunk.
This organism consists of multiple kinds of genes.
Some of them are Neoscopelus macrolepidotus, Neoscopelus microchir, Scopelengys tristis, Solivomer arenidens which is a group currently including 250 species., and much more.

The horizon or skyline is the apparent line that separates earth from sky , the line that divides all visible directions into two categories: those that intersect the Earth's surface, and those that do not.The true horizon is actually a theoretical line, which can only be observed when it lies on the sea surface.
At many locations, this line is obscured by land, trees, buildings, mountains, etc., and the resulting intersection of earth and sky is called the visible horizon .
When looking at a sea from a shore, the part of the sea closest to the horizon is called the offing .
The true horizon is horizontal.
It surrounds the observer and it is typically assumed to be a circle, drawn on the surface of a perfectly spherical model of the Earth .
Its center is below the observer and below sea level .
Its distance from the observer varies from day to day due to atmospheric refraction , which is greatly affected by weather conditions.
Also, the higher the observer's eyes are from sea level, the farther away the horizon is from the observer.
For instance, in standard atmospheric conditions , for an observer with eye level above sea level by 1.70 metres (5 ft 7 in), the horizon is at a distance of about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi).
When observed from very high standpoints, such as a space station , the horizon is much farther away and it encompasses a much larger area of Earth's surface.
In this case, it becomes evident that the horizon more closely resembles an ellipse than a perfect circle, especially when the observer is above the equator, and that the Earth's surface can be better modeled as an ellipsoid than as a sphere.
The word horizon derives from the Greek ὁρίζων κύκλος horizōn kyklos , separating circle, , where ὁρίζων is from the verb ὁρίζω horizō , to divide, to separate, which in turn derives from ὅρος ( oros ), boundary, landmark.
A courthouse (sometimes written court house ) is a building that is home to a local court of law and often the regional county government as well, although this is not the case in some larger cities.
The term is common in North America .
In most other English-speaking countries , buildings which house courts of law are simply called courts or court buildings.
In most of Continental Europe and former non-English-speaking European colonies, the equivalent term is a palace of justice ( French : palais de justice , Italian : palazzo di giustizia , Portuguese : palácio da justiça ).
Application is any material, product or a program which is designed for end-user to use.
Application may refer to:
An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy .
Heat engines , like the internal combustion engine , burn a fuel to create heat which is then used to do work .
Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, pneumatic motors use compressed air , and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy .
In biological systems, molecular motors , like myosins in muscles , use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion.
Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia .
With few exceptions, animals consume organic material , breathe oxygen , are able to move , can reproduce sexually , and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula , during embryonic development .
Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described —of which around 1 million are insects —but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total.
Animals range in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres (110 ft) and have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs .
The category includes humans , but in colloquial use the term animal often refers only to non-human animals.
The study of non-human animals is known as zoology .
Most living animal species are in the Bilateria , a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan.
The Bilateria include the protostomes —in which many groups of invertebrates are found, such as nematodes , arthropods , and molluscs —and the deuterostomes , containing the echinoderms and chordates (including the vertebrates ).
Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian .
Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion which began around 542 million years ago.
6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago .
Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without.
Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae , which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809.
In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa , single-celled organisms no longer considered animals.
In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics , which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between animal taxa .
Humans make use of many other animal species for food, including meat , milk , and eggs ; for materials, such as leather and wool ; as pets ; and as working animals for power and transport.
Dogs have been used in hunting , while many terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport.
Non-human animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.

The kilogram (also kilogramme ) is the base unit of mass in the metric system , formally the International System of Units (SI), having the unit symbol kg .
It is a widely used measure in science, engineering, and commerce worldwide, and is often called a kilo .
The kilogram is almost exactly the mass of one litre of water .
The kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of a litre of water.
This was a simple definition, but hard to replicate precisely.
In 1799, the Kilogramme des Archives , a platinum artefact, replaced it as the standard of mass.
In 1879 a cylinder of platinum-iridium, the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK) became the standard of the unit of mass for the metric system, and remained so until May 20, 2019, , making the kilogram the last of the metric base units to be defined by a physical artefact.
Despite best efforts to maintain it, evidence accumulated that the mass of the International Prototype Kilogram had been changing; the IPK had diverged from its replicas by approximately 50 micrograms since their manufacture late in the 19th century.
This led to several competing efforts to develop measurement technology precise enough to allow replacing the kilogram artefact with a definition based directly on physical fundamental constants.
This culminated in 2018 with a redefinition of the kilogram in terms of the Planck constant .
As a result of this redefinition, the kilogram is now defined in terms of the second and the metre, replacing the IPK as primary standard.
The new definition was approved by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) on November 16, 2018.
Physical standard masses such as the IPK and its replicas still serve as secondary standards.
A label (as distinct from signage ) is a piece of paper , plastic film , cloth , metal , or other material affixed to a container or product , on which is written or printed information or symbols about the product or item.
Information printed directly on a container or article can also be considered labeling .
Labels have many uses, including providing information on a product's origin, manufacturer (e.g., brand name ), use, shelf-life and disposal, some or all of which may be governed by legislation such as that for food in the UK or United States.
Methods of production and attachment to packaging are many and various and may also be subject to internationally recognised standards .
In many countries, hazardous products such as poisons or flammable liquids must have a warning label.
The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs found in vertebrates .
They are located on the left and right in the retroperitoneal space , and in adult humans are about 11 centimetres (4.3 in) in length.
They receive blood from the paired renal arteries ; blood exits into the paired renal veins .
Each kidney is attached to a ureter , a tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder .
The nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney.
Each human adult kidney contains around 1 million nephrons, while a mouse kidney contains only about 12,500 nephrons.
The kidney participates in the control of the volume of various body fluid compartments, fluid osmolality , acid-base balance , various electrolyte concentrations, and removal of toxins .
Filtration occurs in the glomerulus : one-fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys is filtered.
Examples of substances reabsorbed are solute-free water , sodium , bicarbonate , glucose , and amino acids .
Examples of substances secreted are hydrogen , ammonium , potassium and uric acid .
The kidneys also carry out functions independent of the nephron.
For example, they convert a precursor of vitamin D to its active form, calcitriol ; and synthesize the hormones erythropoietin and renin .
Renal physiology is the study of kidney function .
Nephrology is the medical specialty which addresses diseases of kidney function : these include chronic kidney disease , nephritic and nephrotic syndromes , acute kidney injury , and pyelonephritis .
Urology addresses diseases of kidney (and urinary tract) anatomy : these include cancer , renal cysts , kidney stones and ureteral stones , and urinary tract obstruction .
Procedures used in the management of kidney disease include chemical and microscopic examination of the urine ( urinalysis ), measurement of kidney function by calculating the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the serum creatinine ; and kidney biopsy and CT scan to evaluate for abnormal anatomy.
Dialysis and kidney transplantation are used to treat kidney failure ; one (or both sequentially) of these are almost always used when renal function drops below 15%.
Nephrectomy is frequently used to cure renal cell carcinoma .
Measurement is the assignment of a number to a characteristic of an object or event, which can be compared with other objects or events.
The scope and application of measurement are dependent on the context and discipline.
In the natural sciences and engineering , measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the International vocabulary of metrology published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures .
However, in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioral sciences , measurements can have multiple levels , which would include nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales.
Measurement is a cornerstone of trade , science , technology , and quantitative research in many disciplines.
Historically, many measurement systems existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields.
Often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators.
Since the 18th century, developments progressed towards unifying, widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern International System of Units (SI).
This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units.
The science of measurement is pursued in the field of metrology .
A mobile phone , cell phone , cellphone , or hand phone , sometimes shortened to simply mobile , cell or just phone , is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area.
The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator , which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture, and, therefore, mobile telephones are called cellular telephones or cell phones , in North America.
In addition to telephony , 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services , such as text messaging , MMS , email , Internet access , short-range wireless communications ( infrared , Bluetooth ), business applications, video games , and digital photography .
Mobile phones offering only those capabilities are known as feature phones ; mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones .
The first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated by John F.
Mitchell and Martin Cooper of Motorola in 1973, using a handset weighing c.
2 kilograms (4.4 lbs).
In 1979, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) launched the world's first cellular network in Japan.
In 1983, the DynaTAC 8000x was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone.
From 1983 to 2014, worldwide mobile phone subscriptions grew to over seven billion—enough to provide one for every person on Earth.
In first quarter of 2016, the top smartphone developers worldwide were Samsung , Apple , and Huawei , and smartphone sales represented 78 percent of total mobile phone sales.
For feature phones (or dumbphones) as of 2016 , the largest were Samsung, Nokia , and Alcatel .
A riot ( ) is a form of civil disorder commonly characterized by a group lashing out in a violent public disturbance against authority , property or people .
Riots typically involve theft , vandalism , and destruction of property, public or private.
The property targeted varies depending on the riot and the inclinations of those involved.
Targets can include shops, cars, restaurants, state-owned institutions, and religious buildings.
Riots often occur in reaction to a grievance or out of dissent .
Historically, riots have occurred due to poor people with no jobs or living conditions , governmental oppression , taxation or conscription , conflicts between ethnic groups , ( race riot ) or religions ( sectarian violence , pogrom ), the outcome of a sporting event ( sports riot , football hooliganism ) or frustration with legal channels through which to air grievances.
While individuals may attempt to lead or control a riot, riots typically consist of disorganized groups that are frequently chaotic and exhibit herd behavior .
However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that riots are not irrational, herd-like behavior, but actually follow inverted social norms.
Ashton , in his study of food riots among colliers , noted that the turbulence of the colliers is, of course, to be accounted for by something more elementary than politics: it was the instinctive reaction of virility to hunger.
Charles Wilson noted, Spasmodic rises in food prices provoked keelmen on the Tyne to riot in 1709, tin miners to plunder granaries at Falmouth in 1727.
Today, some rioters have an improved understanding of the tactics used by police in riot situations.
Manuals for successful rioting are available on the internet, with tips such as encouraging rioters to get the press involved, as there is more safety and attention with the cameras rolling.
Civilians with video cameras may also have an effect on both rioters and police.
Dealing with riots is often a difficult task for police forces.
They may use tear gas or CS gas to control rioters.
Riot police may use less-than-lethal methods of control, such as shotguns that fire flexible baton rounds to injure or otherwise incapacitate rioters for easier arrest.
Computer software , or simply software , is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work.
This is in contrast to physical hardware , from which the system is built and actually performs the work.
In computer science and software engineering , computer software is all information processed by computer systems , programs and data .
Computer software includes computer programs , libraries and related non-executable data , such as online documentation or digital media .
Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.
At the lowest programming level, executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor —typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU).
A machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state.
For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user.
An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations , for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user .
The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to jump to a different instruction , or is interrupted by the operating system.
As of 2015 , most personal computers , smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together, and computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past.
The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages .
They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to natural languages than machine languages.
High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two.
Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language , which has strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler .

Ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding , decoding , regulation and expression of genes .
RNA and DNA are nucleic acids , and, along with lipids , proteins and carbohydrates , constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life .
Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides , but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand.
Cellular organisms use messenger RNA ( mRNA ) to convey genetic information (using the nitrogenous bases of guanine , uracil , adenine , and cytosine , denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) that directs synthesis of specific proteins.
Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome .
Some RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression , or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals.
One of these active processes is protein synthesis , a universal function in which RNA molecules direct the synthesis of proteins on ribosomes .
This process uses transfer RNA ( tRNA ) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) then links amino acids together to form coded proteins.
A professional is a member of a profession or any person who earns their living from a specified professional activity.
The term also describes the standards of education and training that prepare members of the profession with the particular knowledge and skills necessary to perform their specific role within that profession.
In addition, most professionals are subject to strict codes of conduct, enshrining rigorous ethical and moral obligations .
Professional standards of practice and ethics for a particular field are typically agreed upon and maintained through widely recognized professional associations , such as the IEEE .
Some definitions of professional limit this term to those professions that serve some important aspect of public interest and the general good of society.
In some cultures, the term is used as shorthand to describe a particular social stratum of well-educated workers who enjoy considerable work autonomy and who are commonly engaged in creative and intellectually challenging work.

In economics , cash is money in the physical form of currency , such as banknotes and coins .
In bookkeeping and finance , cash is current assets comprising currency or currency equivalents that can be accessed immediately or near-immediately (as in the case of money market accounts ).
Cash is seen either as a reserve for payments, in case of a structural or incidental negative cash flow or as a way to avoid a downturn on financial markets.
Vinegar is an aqueous solution of acetic acid and trace chemicals that may include flavorings .
Vinegar typically contains 5–20% acetic acid by volume.
Usually the acetic acid is produced by the fermentation of ethanol or sugars by acetic acid bacteria .
There are many types of vinegar, depending upon the source materials.
Vinegar is now mainly used in the culinary arts : as a flavorful, acidic cooking ingredient , or in pickling .
As the most easily manufactured mild acid , it has historically had a wide variety of industrial and domestic uses ; such as its use as a household cleaner .
A nightmare , also called a bad dream , is an unpleasant dream that can cause a strong emotional response from the mind, typically fear but also despair , anxiety and great sadness .
However, psychological nomenclature differentiates between nightmares and bad dreams, specifically, people remain asleep during bad dreams whereas nightmares awaken individuals.
Further, the process of psychological homeostasis employs bad dreams to protect an individual's Homeostatically Protected Mood (HPMood) from the impact of elevated anxiety levels.
During sleep, nightmares indicate the failure of the homeostatic system employing bad dreams to extinguish anxiety accumulated throughout the day.
The dream may contain situations of discomfort, psychological or physical terror or panic.
After a nightmare, a person will often awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a short period of time.
Nightmares can have physical causes such as sleeping in an uncomfortable position or having a fever , or psychological causes such as stress or anxiety .
Eating before going to sleep, which triggers an increase in the body's metabolism and brain activity, is a potential stimulus for nightmares.
Recurrent nightmares may require medical help, as they can interfere with sleeping patterns and cause insomnia .
Spring ( s ) may refer to:
A drug is any substance that causes a change in an organism's physiology or psychology when consumed .
Drugs are typically distinguished from food and substances that provide nutritional support.
Consumption of drugs can be via inhalation , injection , smoking , ingestion , absorption via a patch on the skin, or dissolution under the tongue .
In pharmacology , a drug is a chemical substance, typically of known structure, which, when administered to a living organism, produces a biological effect.
A pharmaceutical drug , also called a medication or medicine, is a chemical substance used to treat , cure , prevent , or diagnose a disease or to promote well-being .
Traditionally drugs were obtained through extraction from medicinal plants , but more recently also by organic synthesis .
Pharmaceutical drugs may be used for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for chronic disorders .
Pharmaceutical drugs are often classified into drug classes —groups of related drugs that have similar chemical structures , the same mechanism of action (binding to the same biological target ), a related mode of action , and that are used to treat the same disease.
The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC), the most widely used drug classification system, assigns drugs a unique ATC code , which is an alphanumeric code that assigns it to specific drug classes within the ATC system.
Another major classification system is the Biopharmaceutics Classification System .
This classifies drugs according to their solubility and permeability or absorption properties.
Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances that affect the function of the central nervous system , altering perception , mood or consciousness .
These drugs are divided into different groups like: stimulants , depressants , antidepressants , anxiolytics , antipsychotics , and hallucinogens .
These psychotropic drugs have been proven useful in treating wide range of medical conditions including mental disorders around the world.
The most widely used drugs in the world include caffeine , nicotine and alcohol , which are also considered recreational drugs , since they are used for pleasure rather than medicinal purposes.
Abuse of several psychoactive drugs can cause psychological or physical addiction .
It's worth noting that all drugs can have potential side effects .
Excessive use of stimulants can promote stimulant psychosis .
Many recreational drugs are illicit and international treaties such as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs exist for the purpose of their prohibition .

A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming .
Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs .
These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.
A complete computer including the hardware , the operating system (main software ), and peripheral equipment required and used for full operation can be referred to as a computer system .
This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster .
Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices .
This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls , factory devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design , and also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones .
The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users.
Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices.
Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the abacus aided people in doing calculations.
Early in the Industrial Revolution , some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms .
More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century.
The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II .
The first transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the MOS transistor and integrated circuit in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s.
The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with MOS transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace, as predicted by Moore's law .
Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element , typically a central processing unit (CPU), and some form of memory .
The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information .
Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen ).
Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.
Contemporary business and science treat as a project (or program) any undertaking, carried out individually or collaboratively and possibly involving research or design, that is carefully planned (usually by a project team ) to achieve a particular aim.
An alternative view sees a project managerially as a sequence of events: a set of interrelated tasks to be executed over a fixed period and within certain cost and other limitations.
A project may be a temporary (rather than permanent) social system ( work system ), possibly constituted by teams (within or across organizations ) to accomplish particular tasks under time constraints .
A project may be a part of wider programme management or an ad hoc structure.
Note that open-source software projects (for example) may lack defined team-membership, precise planning and time-limited durations.
In human social behavior , discrimination is treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction towards, a person based on the group, class, or category to which the person is perceived to belong.
These include age , caste , colour , criminal record , height , disability , ethnicity , family status , gender identity , generation , genetic characteristics , marital status , nationality , race , religion , sex , sexual orientation , and social class .
Discrimination consists of treatment of an individual or group, based on their actual or perceived membership in a certain group or social category, in a way that is worse than the way people are usually treated.
It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction going on to influence the individual's actual behavior towards the group leader or the group, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group, leading to the exclusion of the individual or entities based on illogical or irrational decision making.
Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and institutions in every part of the world, including in territories where discrimination is generally looked down upon.
In some places, controversial attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination—but they have sometimes been called reverse discrimination .
A suburb is a mixed-use or residential area , existing either as part of a city or urban area or as a separate residential community within commuting distance of a city.
In most English-speaking countries , suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner-city areas, but in Australian English and South African English , suburb has become largely synonymous with what is called a neighborhood in other countries and the term extends to inner-city areas.
In some areas, such as Australia , India , China , New Zealand , the United Kingdom , and parts of the United States and Canada , new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities.
In others, such as Saudi Arabia , France , and much of the United States and Canada, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county .
In the United States, beyond the suburbs are exurbs , or exurban areas, with less density but linked to the metropolitan area economically and by commuters.
Suburbs first emerged on a large scale in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of improved rail and road transport, which led to an increase in commuting.
In general, they have lower population densities than inner city neighborhoods within a metropolitan area, and most residents commute to central cities or other business districts ; however, there are many exceptions, including industrial suburbs , planned communities , and satellite cities .
Suburbs tend to proliferate around cities that have an abundance of adjacent flat land.
Waste (or wastes ) are unwanted or unusable materials.
Waste is any substance which is discarded after primary use, or is worthless, defective and of no use.
A by-product by contrast is a joint product of relatively minor economic value.
A waste product may become a by-product, joint product or resource through an invention that raises a waste product's value above zero.
Examples include municipal solid waste (household trash/refuse), hazardous waste , wastewater (such as sewage , which contains bodily wastes ( feces and urine ) and surface runoff ), radioactive waste , and others.
A nymph ( Greek : νύμφη nýmphē, Ancient: nýmpʰɛː Modern: nífi ) in Greek mythology is a supernatural being associated with many other minor female deities that are often associated with the air, seas, woods, or water, or particular locations or landforms.
Different from Greek goddesses , nymphs are more generally regarded as divine spirits who animate or maintain Nature (natural forces reified and considered as a sentient being) for the environments where they live, and are usually depicted as beautiful, young graceful maidens.
They were not necessarily immortal, but lived many years before they died.
They are often divided into various broad subgroups, such as Aurai (winds), Hesperides (evening and sunsets), Nereides (seas), Naiades or (rivers and streams), Oceanids (water), Dryades (trees and forests) or Alseids (groves and glens.)
Nymphs often feature in many classic works of art, literature, mythology and in fiction.
Since medieval times, nymphs are sometimes popularly associated, or even confused, with the mythical or spiritual fairies .
Canadians ( French : Canadiens ) are people identified with the country of Canada .
This connection may be residential, legal, historical or cultural.
For most Canadians, several (or all) of these connections exist and are collectively the source of their being Canadian .
Canada is a multilingual and multicultural society home to people of many different ethnic, religious, and national origins, with the majority of the population made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants.
Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization , different waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today.
Elements of Indigenous, French, British, and more recent immigrant customs, languages, and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada , and thus a Canadian identity .
Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic, and economic neighbour—the United States .
Canadian independence from the United Kingdom grew gradually over the course of many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867.
World War I and World War II in particular, gave rise to a desire among Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship.
Legislative independence was established with the passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931 , the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946 took effect on January 1, 1947, and full sovereignty was achieved with the patriation of the constitution in 1982.
Canada's nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom .
Legislation since the mid-20th century represents Canadians' commitment to multilateralism and socioeconomic development .
Engineers , as practitioners of engineering , are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build, and test machines, systems, structures and materials to fulfill objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost.
The word engineer ( Latin ingeniator ) is derived from the Latin words ingeniare (to create, generate, contrive, devise) and ingenium (cleverness).
The foundational qualifications of an engineer typically include a four-year bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice (culminating in a project report or thesis) and passage of engineering board examinations.
The work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.
Cardiology (from Greek καρδίᾱ kardiā , heart and -λογία -logia , study) is a branch of medicine that deals with the disorders of the heart as well as some parts of the circulatory system .
The field includes medical diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart defects , coronary artery disease , heart failure , valvular heart disease and electrophysiology .
Physicians who specialize in this field of medicine are called cardiologists , a specialty of internal medicine .
Pediatric cardiologists are pediatricians who specialize in cardiology.
Physicians who specialize in cardiac surgery are called cardiothoracic surgeons or cardiac surgeons , a specialty of general surgery .
Although the cardiovascular system is inextricably linked to blood, cardiology is relatively unconcerned with hematology and its diseases.
Some obvious exceptions that affect the function of the heart would be blood tests ( electrolyte disturbances, troponins ), decreased oxygen carrying capacity ( anemia , hypovolemic shock ), and coagulopathies .
Communication (from Latin communicare , meaning to share) is the act of conveying meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs , symbols , and semiotic rules.
The main steps inherent to all communication are:
The scientific study of communication can be divided into:
The channel of communication can be visual , auditory , tactile (such as in Braille ) and haptic , olfactory , electromagnetic , or biochemical .
Human communication is unique for its extensive use of abstract language .
Development of civilization has been closely linked with progress in telecommunication .
The human voice consists of sound made by a human being using the vocal tract , such as talking , singing , laughing , crying , screaming , etc.
The human voice frequency is specifically a part of human sound production in which the vocal folds (vocal cords) are the primary sound source.
(Other sound production mechanisms produced from the same general area of the body involve the production of unvoiced consonants , clicks , whistling and whispering .)
Generally speaking, the mechanism for generating the human voice can be subdivided into three parts; the lungs, the vocal folds within the larynx (voice box), and the articulators.
The lung , the pump must produce adequate airflow and air pressure to vibrate vocal folds.
The vocal folds (vocal cords) then vibrate to use airflow from the lungs to create audible pulses that form the laryngeal sound source.
The muscles of the larynx adjust the length and tension of the vocal folds to fine-tune pitch and tone .
The articulators (the parts of the vocal tract above the larynx consisting of tongue , palate , cheek , lips , etc.) articulate and filter the sound emanating from the larynx and to some degree can interact with the laryngeal airflow to strengthen it or weaken it as a sound source.
The vocal folds, in combination with the articulators, are capable of producing highly intricate arrays of sound.
The tone of voice may be modulated to suggest emotions such as anger , surprise , fear , happiness or sadness .
The human voice is used to express emotion, and can also reveal the age and sex of the speaker.
Singers use the human voice as an instrument for creating music .
A prison , also known as a correctional facility , jail , gaol (dated, British and Australian English), penitentiary ( American English ), detention center ( American English ), remand center , or internment facility (commonly used term in military theatres of war/involvement), is a facility in which inmates are forcibly confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state .
Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial ; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment.
In simplest terms, a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed.
Prisons can also be used as a tool of political repression by authoritarian regimes.
Their perceived opponents may be imprisoned for political crimes , often without trial or other legal due process ; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice.
In times of war, prisoners of war or detainees may be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps , and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps .
In American English , prison and jail are usually treated as having separate definitions.
The term prison or penitentiary tends to describe institutions that incarcerate people for longer periods of time, such as many years, and are operated by the state or federal governments.
The term jail tends to describe institutions for confining people for shorter periods of time (e.g. for shorter sentences or pre-trial detention ) and are usually operated by local governments.
Outside of North America, prison and jail have the same meaning.
Common slang terms for a prison include: the pokey, the slammer, the can, the clink, the joint, the calaboose, the hoosegow and the big house.
Slang terms for imprisonment include: behind bars, in stir and up the river (a possible reference to Sing Sing ).
Existence is the ability of an entity to interact with physical or mental reality .
In philosophy, it refers to the ontological property of being .
The calorie is a unit of energy .
There are actually two units with the name that have been widely used.
The small calorie or gram calorie (usually denoted cal ) is the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius (or one kelvin ).
The large calorie , food calorie , or kilocalorie ( Cal or kcal ) is the amount of heat needed to cause the same increase on one kilogram of water.
Thus, 1 kcal = 1000 cal.
The large calorie is sometimes written Calorie (with a capital C) to distinguish from the other unit.
However, this convention cannot be relied upon, since it is often ignored – especially in non-technical publications.
Although both units are related to the metric system , they have been considered obsolete, or deprecated, in scientific usage, since the adoption of the SI system .
The SI unit of energy is the joule , with symbol J; one small calorie is now defined as exactly 4.184 J, and one large calorie is 4184 J.
However, the two units are still used occasionally in technical work, and the large calorie is still widely used in nutrition .
In most countries, the labels of industrialized food products are required to indicate the nutritional energy value in (large) calories per serving or per weight.
ATM or atm often refers to:
ATM or atm may also refer to:
Unemployment , or joblessness , is a situation in which able-bodied people who are looking for a job cannot find a job.
The causes of unemployment are heavily debated.
Classical economics , new classical economics , and the Austrian School of economics argued that market mechanisms are reliable means of resolving unemployment.
These theories argue against interventions imposed on the labor market from the outside, such as unionization, bureaucratic work rules, minimum wage laws , taxes, and other regulations that they claim discourage the hiring of workers.
Keynesian economics emphasizes the cyclical nature of unemployment and recommends government interventions in the economy that it claims will reduce unemployment during recessions.
This theory focuses on recurrent shocks that suddenly reduce aggregate demand for goods and services and thus reduce demand for workers.
Keynesian models recommend government interventions designed to increase demand for workers; these can include financial stimuli, publicly funded job creation, and expansionist monetary policies.
Its namesake economist, John Maynard Keynes , believed that the root cause of unemployment is the desire of investors to receive more money rather than produce more products, which is not possible without public bodies producing new money.
A third group of theories emphasize the need for a stable supply of capital and investment to maintain full employment .
On this view, government should guarantee full employment through fiscal policy, monetary policy and trade policy as stated, for example, in the US Employment Act of 1946 , by counteracting private sector or trade investment volatility, and reducing inequality .
In addition to theories of unemployment, there are a few categorizations of unemployment that are used to more precisely model the effects of unemployment within the economic system.
Some of the main types of unemployment include structural unemployment and frictional unemployment , as well as cyclical unemployment , involuntary unemployment , and classical unemployment .
Structural unemployment focuses on foundational problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labor markets, including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets.
Structural arguments emphasize causes and solutions related to disruptive technologies and globalization .
Discussions of frictional unemployment focus on voluntary decisions to work based on each individuals' valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates plus the time and effort required to find a job.
Causes and solutions for frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold and wage rates.
The unemployment rate is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force .
During periods of recession , an economy usually experiences a relatively high unemployment rate.
Millions of people globally or 6% of the world's workforce were without a job in 2012.
X-rays make up X-radiation , a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation .
Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers , corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10 Hz to 3×10 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV .
X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays .
In many languages, X-radiation is referred to as Röntgen radiation , after the German scientist Wilhelm Röntgen who discovered it on November 8, 1895.
He named it X-radiation to signify an unknown type of radiation.
Spelling of X-ray(s) in the English language includes the variants x-ray(s) , xray(s) , and X ray(s) .

A website or web site is a collection of related network web resources , such as web pages , multimedia content, which are typically identified with a common domain name , and published on at least one web server .
Notable examples are wikipedia.org , google.com , and amazon.com .
Websites can be accessed via a public Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as the Internet , or a private local area network (LAN), by a uniform resource locator (URL) that identifies the site.
Websites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a personal website , a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc.
Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, ranging from entertainment and social networking to providing news and education.
All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web , while private websites, such as a company's website for its employees, are typically part of an intranet .
Web pages, which are the building blocks of websites, are documents, typically composed in plain text interspersed with formatting instructions of Hypertext Markup Language ( HTML , XHTML ).
They may incorporate elements from other websites with suitable markup anchors .
Web pages are accessed and transported with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which may optionally employ encryption ( HTTP Secure , HTTPS) to provide security and privacy for the user.
The user's application, often a web browser , renders the page content according to its HTML markup instructions onto a display terminal .
Hyperlinking between web pages conveys to the reader the site structure and guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page containing a directory of the site web content .
Some websites require user registration or subscription to access content.
Examples of subscription websites include many business sites, news websites, academic journal websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, message boards , web-based email , social networking websites, websites providing real-time stock market data, as well as sites providing various other services.
End users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktop and laptop computers , tablet computers , smartphones and smart TVs .
An ambulance is a medically equipped vehicle which transports patients to treatment facilities, such as hospitals.
In some instances, out-of-hospital medical care is provided to the patient.
Ambulances are used to respond to medical emergencies by emergency medical services .
For this purpose, they are generally equipped with flashing warning lights and sirens .
They can rapidly transport paramedics and other first responders to the scene, carry equipment for administering emergency care and transport patients to hospital or other definitive care.
Most ambulances use a design based on vans or pick-up trucks .
Others take the form of motorcycles , cars, buses, aircraft and boats (see below: Vehicle types ).
In Japan, This car operated by Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications
Generally, vehicles count as an ambulance if they can transport patients.
However, it varies by jurisdiction as to whether a non-emergency patient transport vehicle (also called an ambulette ) is counted as an ambulance.
These vehicles are not usually (although there are exceptions) equipped with life-support equipment, and are usually crewed by staff with fewer qualifications than the crew of emergency ambulances.
Conversely, EMS agencies may also have emergency response vehicles that cannot transport patients.
These are known by names such as nontransporting EMS vehicles, fly-cars or response vehicles .
The term ambulance comes from the Latin word ambulare as meaning to walk or move about which is a reference to early medical care where patients were moved by lifting or wheeling.
The word originally meant a moving hospital, which follows an army in its movements.
Ambulances (Ambulancias in Spanish) were first used for emergency transport in 1487 by the Spanish forces during the siege of Málaga by the Catholic Monarchs against the Emirate of Granada.
During the American Civil War vehicles for conveying the wounded off the field of battle were called ambulance wagons.
Field hospitals were still called ambulances during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and in the Serbo-Turkish war of 1876 even though the wagons were first referred to as ambulances about 1854 during the Crimean War .

An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy .
Heat engines , like the internal combustion engine , burn a fuel to create heat which is then used to do work .
Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, pneumatic motors use compressed air , and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy .
In biological systems, molecular motors , like myosins in muscles , use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion.
A nation is a stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, history, ethnicity, or psychological make-up manifested in a common culture .
A nation is more overtly political than an ethnic group ; it has been described as a fully mobilized or institutionalized ethnic group.
Some nations are ethnic groups (see ethnic nationalism ) and some are not (see civic nationalism and multiculturalism ).
It is a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity, and particular interests.
Benedict Anderson has characterised a nation as an imagined community and Paul James sees it as an abstract community.
A nation is an imagined community in the sense that the material conditions exist for imagining extended and shared connections.
It is an abstract community in the sense that it is objectively impersonal, even if each individual in the nation experiences him or herself as subjectively part of an embodied unity with others.
For the most part, members of a nation remain strangers to each other and will likely never meet.
Hence the phrase, a nation of strangers used by such writers as Vance Packard .
A male ( ♂ ) organism is the physiological sex that produces sperm .
Each spermatozoon can fuse with a larger female gamete, or ovum , in the process of fertilization .
A male cannot reproduce sexually without access to at least one ovum from a female, but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually.
Most male mammals , including male humans, have a Y chromosome , which codes for the production of larger amounts of testosterone to develop male reproductive organs .
Not all species share a common sex-determination system .
In most animals , including humans , sex is determined genetically , but in some species it can be determined due to social, environmental, or other factors.
For example, Cymothoa exigua changes sex depending on the number of females present in the vicinity.

A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students (or pupils) under the direction of teachers.
Most countries have systems of formal education , which is commonly compulsory .
In these systems, students progress through a series of schools.
The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education.
An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university , but these higher education institutions are usually not compulsory.
In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (Elementary in the US) and secondary (Middle school in the US) education.
Kindergarten or pre-school provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5).
University , vocational school , college or seminary may be available after secondary school.
A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or a school of dance.
Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.
There are also non-government schools, called private schools.
Private schools may be required when the government does not supply adequate, or special education.
Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools , madrasa , hawzas (Shi'a schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements.
Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training , military education and training and business schools .
In home schooling and online schools , teaching and learning take place outside a traditional school building.
Schools are commonly organized in several different organizational models , including departmental, small learning communities, academies, integrated, and schools-within-a-school.
Walmart Inc.
( ; formerly Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
) is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas .
The company was founded by Sam Walton in 1962 and incorporated on October 31, 1969.
It also owns and operates Sam's Club retail warehouses.
As of April 30, 2019, Walmart has 11,368 stores and clubs in 27 countries, operating under 55 different names.
The company operates under the name Walmart in the United States and Canada, as Walmart de México y Centroamérica in Mexico and Central America, as Asda in the United Kingdom, as the Seiyu Group in Japan, and as Best Price in India.
It has wholly owned operations in Argentina, Chile, Canada, and South Africa.
Since August 2018, Walmart only holds a minority stake in Walmart Brasil, with 20-percent of the company's shares, and private equity firm Advent International holding 80-percent ownership of the company.
Walmart is the world's largest company by revenue, over US$ 500 billion, according to Fortune Global 500 list in 2018.
It is also the largest private employer in the world with 2.2 million employees.
It is a publicly traded family-owned business, as the company is controlled by the Walton family .
Sam Walton's heirs own over 50-percent of Walmart through their holding company Walton Enterprises and through their individual holdings.
Walmart was the largest U.S. grocery retailer in 2019, and 65-percent of Walmart's US$ 510.329 billion sales came from U.S. operations.
Walmart was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972.
By 1988, it was the most profitable retailer in the U.S., and it had become the largest in terms of revenue by October 1989.
The company originally was geographically limited to the South and lower Midwest, but it had stores from coast to coast by the early 1990s.
Sam's Club opened in New Jersey in November 1989 and the first California outlet opened in Lancaster, California in July 1990.
A Walmart in York, Pennsylvania opened in October 1990, the first main store in the Northeast.
Walmart's investments outside America have seen mixed results.
Its operations and subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Central America, South America and China are highly successful, whereas its ventures failed in Germany and South Korea.
Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia .
With few exceptions, animals consume organic material , breathe oxygen , are able to move , can reproduce sexually , and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula , during embryonic development .
Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described —of which around 1 million are insects —but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total.
Animals range in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres (110 ft) and have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs .
The category includes humans , but in colloquial use the term animal often refers only to non-human animals.
The study of non-human animals is known as zoology .
Most living animal species are in the Bilateria , a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan.
The Bilateria include the protostomes —in which many groups of invertebrates are found, such as nematodes , arthropods , and molluscs —and the deuterostomes , containing the echinoderms and chordates (including the vertebrates ).
Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian .
Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion which began around 542 million years ago.
6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago .
Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without.
Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae , which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809.
In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa , single-celled organisms no longer considered animals.
In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics , which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between animal taxa .
Humans make use of many other animal species for food, including meat , milk , and eggs ; for materials, such as leather and wool ; as pets ; and as working animals for power and transport.
Dogs have been used in hunting , while many terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport.
Non-human animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.
The metre ( Commonwealth spelling and BIPM spelling ) or meter ( American spelling ) (from the French unit mètre , from the Greek noun μέτρον, measure) is the base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI).
The SI unit symbol is m .
The metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1 / 299 792 458 of a second .
The metre was originally defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole – as a result, the Earth's circumference is approximately 40,000 km today.
In 1799, it was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar (the actual bar used was changed in 1889).
In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86 .
In 1983, the current definition was adopted.
The imperial inch is defined as 0.0254 metres (2.54 centimetres or 25.4 millimetres).
One metre is about ​ 3 ⁄ 8 inches longer than a yard , i.e. about ​ 39 ⁄ 8 inches.

King , or king regnant , is the title given to a male monarch in a variety of contexts.
The female equivalent is queen regnant , while the title of queen on its own usually refers to the consort of a king.
The term king may also refer to a king consort , a title that is sometimes given to the husband of a ruling queen , but the title of prince consort is sometimes granted instead.
A king dowager is the male equivalent of the queen dowager .
A king father is a king dowager who is also the father of the reigning sovereign.

A shower is a place in which a person bathes under a spray of typically warm or hot water.
Indoors, there is a drain in the floor.
Most showers have temperature, spray pressure and adjustable showerhead nozzle.
The simplest showers have a swivelling nozzle aiming down on the user, while more complex showers have a showerhead connected to a hose that has a mounting bracket.
This allows the showerer to hold the showerhead by hand to spray the water at different parts of their body.
A shower can be installed in a small shower stall or bathtub with a plastic shower curtain or door.
Showering is common in Western culture due to the efficiency of using it compared with a bathtub .
Its use in hygiene is, therefore, common practice.
A shower uses less water on average than a bath: 80 litres (18 imp gal; 21 US gal) for a shower compared with 150 litres (33 imp gal; 40 US gal) for a bath.

Users can access Gmail on the web and using third-party programs that synchronize email content through POP or IMAP protocols.
Gmail started as a limited beta release on April 1, 2004 and ended its testing phase on July 7, 2009.
At launch, Gmail had an initial storage capacity offer of one gigabyte per user, a significantly higher amount than competitors offered at the time.
Today, the service comes with 15 gigabytes of storage.
Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, including attachments, while they can send emails up to 25 megabytes.
In order to send larger files, users can insert files from Google Drive into the message.
Gmail has a search -oriented interface and a conversation view similar to an Internet forum .
The service is notable among website developers for its early adoption of Ajax .
Google's mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including to filter spam and malware , and to add context-sensitive advertisements next to emails.
This advertising practice has been significantly criticized by privacy advocates due to concerns over unlimited data retention , ease of monitoring by third parties, users of other email providers not having agreed to the policy upon sending emails to Gmail addresses, and the potential for Google to change its policies to further decrease privacy by combining information with other Google data usage.
The company has been the subject of lawsuits concerning the issues.
Google has stated that email users must necessarily expect their emails to be subject to automated processing and claims that the service refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages, such as those mentioning race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial statements.
In June 2017, Google announced the upcoming end to the use of contextual Gmail content for advertising purposes, relying instead on data gathered from the use of its other services.
By February 2016, Gmail had one billion active users worldwide.
Groupers are fish of any of a number of genera in the subfamily Epinephelinae of the family Serranidae , in the order Perciformes .
Not all serranids are called groupers; the family also includes the sea basses .
The common name grouper is usually given to fish in one of two large genera : Epinephelus and Mycteroperca .
In addition, the species classified in the small genera Anyperidon , Cromileptes , Dermatolepis , Gracila , Saloptia , and Triso are also called groupers.
Fish in the genus Plectropomus are referred to as coralgroupers .
These genera are all classified in the subfamily Epiphelinae.
However, some of the hamlets (genus Alphestes ), the hinds (genus Cephalopholis ), the lyretails (genus Variola ) and some other small genera ( Gonioplectrus , Niphon , Paranthias ) are also in this subfamily, and occasional species in other serranid genera have common names involving the word grouper.
Nonetheless, the word grouper on its own is usually taken as meaning the subfamily Epinephelinae.
A park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats.
Urban parks are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities.
National parks and Country parks are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside.
State parks and Provincial parks are administered by sub-national government states and agencies.
Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments , fountains or playground structures.
Many parks have fields for playing sports such as soccer , baseball and football , and paved areas for games such as basketball .
Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities.
Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area.
Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills.
The largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands square kilometers (or square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers.
In many large parks, camping in tents is allowed with a permit.
Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g. rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles).
Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a park ranger or a park warden .
Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months.
There are also amusement parks which have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance or skill.
Video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying and broadcasting of moving visual images.
Video may also refer to:
An emir ( ; Arabic : أمير ‎ ʾamīr ʔaˈmiːr ), sometimes transliterated amir , amier , or ameer , is an aristocratic or noble and military title of high office used in a variety of places in the Arab countries , West Africa , and Afghanistan .
It means commander, general, or High King .
The feminine form is emira ( أميرة ʾamīrah ).
When translated as prince, the word emirate is analogous to a sovereign principality .
Technique or Techniques may refer to:
Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion , releasing heat , light , and various reaction products .
Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition.
Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen, O 2 , to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy (418 kJ per 32 g of O 2 ); the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here.
At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced.
The flame is the visible portion of the fire.
Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen.
If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma .
Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.
Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration , which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning .
Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe.
The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems.
The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination.
If fire removes protective vegetation , heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water .
Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil.
This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, which only slowly recovers as nitrogen is fixed from the atmosphere by lightning and by leguminous plants such as clover .
Fire has been used by humans in rituals , in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting , forging , incineration of waste, cremation , and as a weapon or mode of destruction.
Communication (from Latin communicare , meaning to share) is the act of conveying meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs , symbols , and semiotic rules.
The main steps inherent to all communication are:
The scientific study of communication can be divided into:
The channel of communication can be visual , auditory , tactile (such as in Braille ) and haptic , olfactory , electromagnetic , or biochemical .
Human communication is unique for its extensive use of abstract language .
Development of civilization has been closely linked with progress in telecommunication .
Friday is the day of the week between Thursday and Saturday .
In countries adopting the Monday-first convention it is the fifth day of the week .
In countries that adopt the Sunday-first convention, it is the sixth and penultimate day of the week.
In some other countries, for example the Maldives , Friday is the first day of the weekend, with Saturday the second.
In Iran Friday is the last day of the weekend, with Saturday as the first day of the working week.
Bahrain , the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Kuwait also followed this convention until they changed to a Friday–Saturday weekend: on 1 September 2006 in Bahrain and the UAE, and a year later in Kuwait .
In Iran , Friday and Thursday are weekend days.
Anderson (or Andersson ) may refer to:
An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis .
Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results.
There also exists natural experimental studies .
A child may carry out basic experiments to understand gravity, while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to advance their understanding of a phenomenon.
Experiments and other types of hands-on activities are very important to student learning in the science classroom.
Experiments can raise test scores and help a student become more engaged and interested in the material they are learning, especially when used over time.
Experiments can vary from personal and informal natural comparisons (e.g. tasting a range of chocolates to find a favorite), to highly controlled (e.g. tests requiring complex apparatus overseen by many scientists that hope to discover information about subatomic particles).
Uses of experiments vary considerably between the natural and human sciences.
Experiments typically include controls , which are designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single independent variable .
This increases the reliability of the results, often through a comparison between control measurements and the other measurements.
Scientific controls are a part of the scientific method .
Ideally, all variables in an experiment are controlled (accounted for by the control measurements) and none are uncontrolled.
In such an experiment, if all controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the experiment works as intended, and that results are due to the effect of the tested variable.
Tim or TIM may refer to:
In biology , a mutation is the alteration of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of an organism , virus , or extrachromosomal DNA .
Mutations result from errors during DNA replication (especially during meiosis ) or other types of damage to DNA (such as may be caused by exposure to radiation or carcinogens ), which then may undergo error-prone repair (especially microhomology-mediated end joining ), or cause an error during other forms of repair, or else may cause an error during replication ( translesion synthesis ).
Mutations may also result from insertion or deletion of segments of DNA due to mobile genetic elements .
Mutations may or may not produce discernible changes in the observable characteristics ( phenotype ) of an organism.
Mutations play a part in both normal and abnormal biological processes including: evolution , cancer , and the development of the immune system , including junctional diversity .
The genomes of RNA viruses are based on RNA rather than DNA.
The RNA viral genome can be double-stranded (as in DNA) or single-stranded.
In some of these viruses (such as the single-stranded human immunodeficiency virus ) replication occurs quickly and there are no mechanisms to check the genome for accuracy.
This error-prone process often results in mutations.
Mutation can result in many different types of change in sequences.
Mutations in genes can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene , or prevent the gene from functioning properly or completely.
Mutations can also occur in nongenic regions .
One study on genetic variations between different species of Drosophila suggests that, if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, the result is likely to be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms that have damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or marginally beneficial.
Due to the damaging effects that mutations can have on genes, organisms have mechanisms such as DNA repair to prevent or correct mutations by reverting the mutated sequence back to its original state.
Aviation , or air transport , refers to the activities surrounding mechanical flight and the aircraft industry.
Aircraft includes fixed-wing and rotary-wing types, morphable wings, wing-less lifting bodies, as well as lighter-than-air craft such as balloons and airships .
Aviation began in the 18th century with the development of the hot air balloon , an apparatus capable of atmospheric displacement through buoyancy.
Some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of Otto Lilienthal in 1896; then a large step in significance came with the construction of the first powered airplane by the Wright brothers in the early 1900s.
Since that time, aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the jet which permitted a major form of transport throughout the world.
Program , programme , or programming may refer to:
The Mahābhārata ( US : , UK : ; Sanskrit : महाभारतम् , Mahābhāratam , pronounced mɐɦaːˈbʱaːɽɐtɐm ) is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India , the other being the Rāmāyaṇa .
It narrates the struggle between two groups of cousins in the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kaurava and the Pāṇḍava princes and their succession.
Along with the epic Rāmāyaṇa , it forms the Hindu Itihasa .
It also contains philosophical and devotional material, such as a discussion of the four goals of life or puruṣārtha (12.161).
Among the principal works and stories in the Mahābhārata are the Bhagavad Gita , the story of Damayanti , an abbreviated version of the Rāmāyaṇa , and the story of Ṛṣyasringa , often considered as works in their own right.
Traditionally, the authorship of the Mahābhārata is attributed to Vyāsa .
There have been many attempts to unravel its historical growth and compositional layers.
The oldest preserved parts of the text are thought to be not much older than around 400 BCE, though the origins of the epic probably fall between the 8th and 9th centuries BCE.
The text probably reached its final form by the early Gupta period (c.
4th century CE).
According to the Mahābhārata itself, the tale is extended from a shorter version of 24,000 verses called simply Bhārata .
The Mahābhārata is the longest epic poem known and has been described as the longest poem ever written.
Its longest version consists of over 100,000 śloka or over 200,000 individual verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), and long prose passages.
At about 1.8 million words in total, the Mahābhārata is roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined, or about four times the length of the Rāmāyaṇa .
Johnson has compared the importance of the Mahābhārata in the context of world civilization to that of the Bible , the works of William Shakespeare , the works of Homer , Greek drama , or the Quran .
Within the Indian tradition it is sometimes called the Fifth Veda .
Trojan or Trojans may refer to:
In sales , commerce and economics , a customer (sometimes known as a client , buyer , or purchaser ) is the recipient of a good , service , product or an idea - obtained from a seller , vendor , or supplier via a financial transaction or exchange for money or some other valuable consideration .
Stockings (also known as hose , especially in a historical context) are close-fitting, variously elastic garments covering the leg from the foot up to the knee or possibly part or all of the thigh .
Stockings vary in color, design, and transparency .
Today, stockings are primarily worn for fashion and aesthetics , usually in association with mid-length or short skirts .
A recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a dish of prepared food.
The term recipe is also used in medicine or in information technology (e.g., user acceptance ).
A doctor will usually begin a prescription with recipe , Latin for take , usually abbreviated as Rx or the equivalent symbol (℞).
A house is a building that functions as a home .
They can range from simple dwellings such as rudimentary huts of nomadic tribes and the improvised shacks in shantytowns to complex, fixed structures of wood, brick, concrete or other materials containing plumbing, ventilation, and electrical systems.
Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space.
Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers.
Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms , a kitchen or cooking area, and a living room .
A house may have a separate dining room , or the eating area may be integrated into another room.
Some large houses in North America have a recreation room .
In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans.
The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household .
Most commonly, a household is a family unit of some kind, although households may also be other social groups , such as roommates or, in a rooming house , unconnected individuals.
Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure.
A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for vehicles or a shed for gardening equipment and tools.
A house may have a backyard or frontyard, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat.
Thing or The Thing may refer to:
A hand is a prehensile , multi- fingered appendage located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans , chimpanzees , monkeys , and lemurs .
A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each hand and fingerprints extremely similar to human fingerprints ) are often described as having hands instead of paws on their front limbs.
The raccoon is usually described as having hands though opposable thumbs are lacking.
Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally — for example, in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand.
The human hand normally has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb ; these are often referred to collectively as five fingers, however, whereby the thumb is included as one of the fingers.
It has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bone , the number of which varies between people, 14 of which are the phalanges ( proximal , intermediate and distal ) of the fingers and thumb.
The metacarpal bones connect the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist .
Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones.
Fingers contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings in the body, and are the richest source of tactile feedback.
They also have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus, the sense of touch is intimately associated with hands.
Like other paired organs (eyes, feet, legs) each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere , so that handedness —the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning.
Among humans, the hands play an important function in body language and sign language .
Likewise the ten digits of two hands, and the twelve phalanges of four fingers (touchable by the thumb) have given rise to number systems and calculation techniques.
Circuit may refer to:
Gonzalez or González may refer to:
Electronics comprises the physics, engineering, technology and applications that deal with the emission, flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter .
Electronics is widely used in information processing , telecommunication , and signal processing .
The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information-processing possible.
Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards , electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed electronic components into a regular working system , called an electronic system ; examples are computers or control systems .
An electronic system may be a component of another engineered system or a standalone device.
As of 2018 most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control.
The identification of the electron in 1897, along with the invention of the vacuum tube , which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals, inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age.
Commonly, electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements; such a circuit is described as an electronic circuit .
Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors , diodes , integrated circuits , optoelectronics , and sensors , associated passive electrical components , and interconnection technologies.The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible.
Electrical and electromechanical science and technology deals with the generation, distribution, switching, storage, and conversion of electrical energy to and from other energy forms (using wires , motors , generators , batteries , switches , relays , transformers , resistors , and other passive components ).
This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by Lee De Forest of the triode , which made electrical amplification of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device.
Until 1950, this field was called radio technology because its principal application was the design and theory of radio transmitters , receivers , and vacuum tubes .
The term solid-state electronics emerged after the first practical transistor was invented by William Shockley , Walter Houser Brattain and John Bardeen at Bell Labs in 1947.
The electronics industry was revolutionized by the MOSFET (MOS transistor), which was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and is the most widely used electronic device in the world.
The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solid-state physics , whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems come under electronics engineering .
This article focuses on engineering aspects of electronics.
A wife is a female partner in a continuing marital relationship .
The term continues to be applied to a woman who has separated from her partner, and ceases to be applied to such a woman only when her marriage has come to an end, following a legally recognized divorce or the death of her spouse.
On the death of her partner, a wife is referred to as a widow , but not after she is divorced from her partner.
The rights and obligations of a wife in relation to her partner and her status in the community and in law vary between cultures and have varied over time.
Layer (in Sanskrit: 'कला') or layered may refer to:
The Universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets , stars , galaxies , and all other forms of matter and energy .
While the spatial size of the entire Universe is unknown, it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe , which is currently estimated to be 93 billion light years in diameter.
In various multiverse hypotheses, a universe is one of many causally disconnected constituent parts of a larger multiverse , which itself comprises all of space and time and its contents.
The earliest scientific models of the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric , placing Earth at the center of the Universe.
Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System .
In developing the law of universal gravitation , Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus' work as well as observations by Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler 's laws of planetary motion .
Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way , which is one of at least hundreds of billions of galaxies in the Universe.
Many of the stars in our galaxy have planets .
At the largest scale galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center.
At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.
Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then, and is currently still expanding at an increasing rate.
The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the Universe.
Under this theory, space and time emerged together 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years ago and the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the Universe expanded.
After an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around 10 seconds, and the separation of the four known fundamental forces , the Universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form.
Dark matter gradually gathered forming a foam -like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity .
Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense , forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today.
It is possible to see objects that are now further away than 13.799 billion light-years because space itself has expanded , and it is still expanding today.
This means that objects which are now up to 46.5 billion light-years away can still be seen in their distant past, because in the past when their light was emitted, they were much closer to the Earth.
From studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas.
This unseen matter is known as dark matter ( dark means that there is a wide range of strong indirect evidence that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly).
The ΛCDM model is the most widely accepted model of our universe.
It suggests that about 69.2% ± 1.2% 2015 of the mass and energy in the universe is a cosmological constant (or, in extensions to ΛCDM, other forms of dark energy such as a scalar field ) which is responsible for the current expansion of space , and about 25.8% ± 1.1% 2015 is dark matter.
Ordinary ( baryonic ) matter is therefore only 4.9% 2015 of the physical universe.
Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of ordinary matter, or about 0.3% of the entire universe.
There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible.
Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which our universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.
A court is any person or institution with authority to judge or adjudicate, often as a government institution , with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil , criminal , and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law .
In both common law and civil law legal systems , courts are the central means for dispute resolution , and it is generally understood that all people have an ability to bring their claims before a court.
Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.
The system of courts that interprets and applies the law is collectively known as the judiciary .
The place where a court sits is known as a venue .
The room where court proceedings occur is known as a courtroom , and the building as a courthouse ; court facilities range from simple and very small facilities in rural communities to large buildings in cities.
The practical authority given to the court is known as its jurisdiction (Latin: jus dicere' ) – the court's power to decide certain kinds of questions or petitions put to it.
According to William Blackstone 's Commentaries on the Laws of England , a court is constituted by a minimum of three parties: the actor or plaintiff , who complains of an injury done; the reus or defendant , who is called upon to make satisfaction for it, and the judex or judicial power, which is to examine the truth of the fact, to determine the law arising upon that fact, and, if any injury appears to have been done, to ascertain and by its officers to apply a legal remedy .
It is also usual in the superior courts to have barristers, and attorneys or counsel, as assistants, though, often, courts consist of additional barristers, bailiffs , reporters , and perhaps a jury.
The term the court is also used to refer to the presiding officer or officials, usually one or more judges .
The judge or panel of judges may also be collectively referred to as the bench (in contrast to attorneys and barristers , collectively referred to as the bar ).
In the United States , and other common law jurisdictions, the term court (in the case of U.S. federal courts) by law is used to describe the judge himself or herself.
In the United States, the legal authority of a court to take action is based on personal jurisdiction over the parties to the litigation and subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted.
Contemporary business and science treat as a project (or program) any undertaking, carried out individually or collaboratively and possibly involving research or design, that is carefully planned (usually by a project team ) to achieve a particular aim.
An alternative view sees a project managerially as a sequence of events: a set of interrelated tasks to be executed over a fixed period and within certain cost and other limitations.
A project may be a temporary (rather than permanent) social system ( work system ), possibly constituted by teams (within or across organizations ) to accomplish particular tasks under time constraints .
A project may be a part of wider programme management or an ad hoc structure.
Note that open-source software projects (for example) may lack defined team-membership, precise planning and time-limited durations.
Trick may refer to:
In the metric system , a microgram or microgramme is a unit of mass equal to one millionth ( 1 × 10 ) of a gram .
The unit symbol is μg according to the International System of Units ; the recommended symbol in the United States when communicating medical information is mcg .
In μg the prefix symbol for micro- is the Greek letter μ (Mu) .
Strike may refer to:
Garbage , trash , rubbish , or refuse is waste material that is discarded by humans, usually due to a perceived lack of utility.
The term generally does not encompass bodily waste products, purely liquid or gaseous wastes, nor toxic waste products.
Garbage is commonly sorted and classified into kinds of material suitable for specific kinds of disposal.
Zone or The Zone or In the Zone may refer to:
A boy is a young male human , usually a child or adolescent .
When he becomes an adult, he is described as a man .
The term can be joined with a variety of other words to form compound words.
Rock most often refers to:
Rock or Rocks may also refer to:
A blog (a truncation of weblog ) is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary -style text entries (posts).
Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page.
Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic.
In the 2010s, multi-author blogs (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited.
MABs from newspapers , other media outlets, universities , think tanks , advocacy groups , and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic.
The rise of Twitter and other microblogging systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media.
Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog .
The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer programming .
Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts.
In the 2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.
In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service .
Indeed, bloggers do not only produce content to post on their blogs, but also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers.
However, there are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.
Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from politics to sports.
Others function as more personal online diaries , and others function more as online brand advertising of a particular individual or company.
A typical blog combines text, digital images, and links to other blogs, web pages , and other media related to its topic.
The ability of readers to leave publicly viewable comments, and interact with other commenters, is an important contribution to the popularity of many blogs.
However, blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content.
Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art ( art blogs ), photographs ( photoblogs ), videos ( video blogs or vlogs), music ( MP3 blogs ), and audio ( podcasts ).
In education, blogs can be used as instructional resources.
These blogs are referred to as edublogs .
Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.
On 16 February 2011 , there were over 156 million public blogs in existence.On 20 February 2014, there were around 172 million Tumblr and 75.8 million WordPress blogs in existence worldwide.
According to critics and other bloggers, Blogger is the most popular blogging service used today.
However, Blogger does not offer public statistics.
Technorati lists 1.3 million blogs as of February 22, 2014.
Automatic may refer to:
A bell is a directly struck idiophone percussion instrument .
Most bells have the shape of a hollow cup that when struck vibrates in a single strong strike tone , with its sides forming an efficient resonator .
The strike may be made by an internal clapper or uvula, an external hammer, or—in small bells—by a small loose sphere enclosed within the body of the bell ( jingle bell ).
Bells are usually cast from bell metal (a type of bronze ) for its resonant properties, but can also be made from other hard materials; this depends on the function.
Some small bells such as ornamental bells or cow bells can be made from cast or pressed metal, glass or ceramic, but large bells such as church, clock and tower bells are normally cast from bell metal.
Bells intended to be heard over a wide area can range from a single bell hung in a turret or bell-gable , to a musical ensemble such as an English ring of bells , a carillon or a Russian zvon which are tuned to a common scale and installed in a bell tower .
Many public or institutional buildings house bells, most commonly as clock bells to sound the hours and quarters.
Historically, bells have been associated with religious rites, and are still used to call communities together for religious services.
Later, bells were made to commemorate important events or people and have been associated with the concepts of peace and freedom.
The study of bells is called campanology .
A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment.
The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital , which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness.
A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with a large number of beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care.
Specialized hospitals include trauma centers , rehabilitation hospitals , children's hospitals , seniors' ( geriatric ) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital ) and certain disease categories.
Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.
Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received.
A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to medical students and nurses.
The medical facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic .
Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g. surgery and urgent care ) and specialist units such as cardiology .
Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units.
Common support units include a pharmacy , pathology , and radiology .
Hospitals are usually funded by the public sector , health organisations ( for profit or nonprofit ), health insurance companies, or charities , including direct charitable donations.
Historically, hospitals were often founded and funded by religious orders , or by charitable individuals and leaders.
Currently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians , surgeons , nurses , and allied health practitioners , whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by volunteers .
However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the Bon Secours Sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals.
In accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were originally places of hospitality, and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the Royal Hospital Chelsea , established in 1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.
In linguistics , a word is the smallest element that can be uttered in isolation with objective or practical meaning .
This contrasts deeply with a morpheme , which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own.
A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect ), or several ( rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected ), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are -s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed ).A complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes ( rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed ), or more than one root in a compound ( black-board, sand-box ).
Words can be put together to build larger elements of language , such as phrases ( a red rock , put up with ), clauses ( I threw a rock ), and sentences ( He threw a rock too, but he missed ).
The term word may refer to a spoken word or to a written word, or sometimes to the abstract concept behind either.
Spoken words are made up of units of sound called phonemes , and written words of symbols called graphemes , such as the letters of the English alphabet.
Tons can refer to:
An hour ( symbol : h ; also abbreviated hr .) is a unit of time conventionally reckoned as ​ ⁄ 24 of a day and scientifically reckoned as 3,599–3,601 seconds , depending on conditions.
The hour was initially established in the ancient Near East as a variable measure of ​ ⁄ 12 of the night or daytime .
Such seasonal , temporal , or unequal hours varied by season and latitude .
The hour was subsequently divided into 60 minutes , each of 60 seconds .
Equal or equinoctial hours were taken as ​ ⁄ 24 of the day as measured from noon to noon; the minor seasonal variations of this unit were eventually smoothed by making it ​ ⁄ 24 of the mean solar day .
Since this unit was not constant due to long term variations in the Earth's rotation, the hour was finally separated from the Earth's rotation and defined in terms of the atomic or physical second .
In the modern metric system , hours are an accepted unit of time defined as 3,600 atomic seconds.
However, on rare occasions an hour may incorporate a positive or negative leap second , making it last 3,599 or 3,601 seconds, in order to keep it within 0.9 seconds of UT1 , which is based on measurements of the mean solar day .
The killer whale or orca ( Orcinus orca ) is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family, of which it is the largest member.
Killer whales have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey.
Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and other species of dolphin.
They have been known to attack baleen whale calves, and even adult whales.
Killer whales are apex predators , as no animal preys on them.
A cosmopolitan species , they can be found in each of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas, absent only from the Baltic and Black seas, and some areas of the Arctic Ocean.
Killer whales are highly social ; some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups (pods) which are the most stable of any animal species.
Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations, have been described as manifestations of animal culture .
The International Union for Conservation of Nature assesses the orca's conservation status as data deficient because of the likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species .
Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion, habitat loss , pollution (by PCBs ), capture for marine mammal parks , and conflicts with human fisheries .
In late 2005, the southern resident killer whales , which swim in British Columbia and Washington state waters, were placed on the U.S. Endangered Species list .
Wild killer whales are not considered a threat to humans, but there have been cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks.
Killer whales feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, with their reputation ranging from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.
A leg is a weight-bearing and locomotive anatomical structure, usually having a columnar shape.
During locomotion, legs function as extensible struts.
The combination of movements at all joints can be modeled as a single, linear element capable of changing length and rotating about an omnidirectional hip joint.
As an anatomical animal structure it is used for locomotion .
The distal end is often modified to distribute force (such as a foot ).
Most animals have an even number of legs.
As a component of furniture, it is used for the economy of materials needed to provide the support for the useful surface such as the table top or chair seat.
Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape , or planar lamina , in the plane .
Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object .
Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat.
It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).
The area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of a fixed size.
In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit of area is the square metre (written as m ), which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long.
A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares.
In mathematics , the unit square is defined to have area one, and the area of any other shape or surface is a dimensionless real number .
There are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles , rectangles , and circles .
Using these formulas, the area of any polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles .
For shapes with curved boundary, calculus is usually required to compute the area.
Indeed, the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the historical development of calculus .
For a solid shape such as a sphere , cone, or cylinder, the area of its boundary surface is called the surface area .
Formulas for the surface areas of simple shapes were computed by the ancient Greeks , but computing the surface area of a more complicated shape usually requires multivariable calculus .
Area plays an important role in modern mathematics.
In addition to its obvious importance in geometry and calculus, area is related to the definition of determinants in linear algebra , and is a basic property of surfaces in differential geometry .
In analysis , the area of a subset of the plane is defined using Lebesgue measure , though not every subset is measurable.
In general, area in higher mathematics is seen as a special case of volume for two-dimensional regions.
Area can be defined through the use of axioms, defining it as a function of a collection of certain plane figures to the set of real numbers.
It can be proved that such a function exists.
An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane ) is a powered , fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine , propeller or rocket engine .
Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations .
The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation , transportation of goods and people, military , and research.
Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners and transports more than 200 billion tonne - kilometres of cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement.
Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled such as drones.
The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903, recognized as the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.
They built on the works of George Cayley dating from 1799, when he set forth the concept of the modern airplane (and later built and flew models and successful passenger-carrying gliders ).
Between 1867 and 1896, the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal also studied heavier-than-air flight.
Following its limited use in World War I , aircraft technology continued to develop.
Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War II .
The first jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He 178 in 1939.
The first jet airliner , the de Havilland Comet , was introduced in 1952.
The Boeing 707 , the first widely successful commercial jet, was in commercial service for more than 50 years, from 1958 to at least 2013.
Wealth is the abundance of valuable financial assets or physical possessions which can be converted into a form that can be used for transactions .
This includes the core meaning as held in the originating old English word weal , which is from an Indo-European word stem.
The modern concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of economics , and clearly so for growth economics and development economics , yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent.
An individual possessing a substantial net worth is known as wealthy .
Net worth is defined as the current value of one's assets less liabilities (excluding the principal in trust accounts).
At the most general level, economists may define wealth as anything of value that captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept.
Various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different contexts.
Defining wealth can be a normative process with various ethical implications, since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own.
A community, region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources to the benefit of the common good is known as wealthy.
The United Nations definition of inclusive wealth is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural, human, and physical assets.
Natural capital includes land, forests, energy resources , and minerals.
Human capital is the population's education and skills.
Physical (or manufactured) capital includes such things as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure.
Citizenship is the status of a person recognized under the custom or law as being a legal member of a sovereign state or belonging to a nation .
A person may have multiple citizenships .
A person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be stateless , while one who lives on state borders whose territorial status is uncertain is a border-lander.
Nationality is often used as a synonym for citizenship in English – notably in international law – although the term is sometimes understood as denoting a person's membership of a nation (a large ethnic group ).
In some countries, e.g. the United States , the United Kingdom , nationality and citizenship can have different meanings (for more information, see Nationality versus citizenship ).
Violence is the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy.
Less conventional definitions are also used, such as the World Health Organization 's definition of violence as the intentional use of physical force or power , threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation.
Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990.
Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm ( suicide ), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence ( war ) and legal intervention.
In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death.
For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments.
Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development.
In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred.
The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.
Violence in many forms can be preventable.
There is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors in a country such as concentrated (regional) poverty , income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents.
Strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be relatively effective in preventing violence, although mental and physical health and individual responses, personalities, etc.
have always been decisive factors in the formation of these behaviors.
The World Health Organization divides violence into three broad categories:
This initial categorization differentiates between violence a person inflicts upon himself or herself, violence inflicted by another individual or by a small group of individuals, and violence inflicted by larger groups such as states, organized political groups, militia groups and terrorist organizations.
These three broad categories are each divided further to reflect more specific types of violence:
Alternatively, violence can primarily be classified as either instrumental or reactive / hostile.

A leaf is an organ of a vascular plant and is the principal lateral appendage of the stem .
The leaves and stem together form the shoot .
Leaves are collectively referred to as foliage, as in autumn foliage.
A leaf is a dorsiventrally flattened organ , usually borne above ground and specialized for photosynthesis .
In most leaves, the primary photosynthetic tissue, the palisade mesophyll , is located on the upper side of the blade or lamina of the leaf but in some species, including the mature foliage of Eucalyptus , palisade mesophyll is present on both sides and the leaves are said to be isobilateral.
Most leaves have distinct upper surface ( adaxial ) and lower surface ( abaxial ) that differ in color, hairiness, the number of stomata (pores that intake and output gases), the amount and structure of epicuticular wax and other features.
Leaves are mostly green in color.
This is due to the presence of a compound called chlorophyll .
This compound is essential for photosynthesis as it absorbs light energy from the sun.
A leaf with white patches or edges is called a variegated leaf .
Leaves can have many different shapes, sizes, and textures.
The broad, flat leaves with complex venation of flowering plants are known as megaphylls and the species that bear them, the majority, as broad-leaved or megaphyllous plants.
In the clubmosses , with different evolutionary origins, the leaves are simple (with only a single vein) and are known as microphylls.
Some leaves, such as bulb scales, are not above ground.
In many aquatic species, the leaves are submerged in water.
Succulent plants often have thick juicy leaves, but some leaves are without major photosynthetic function and may be dead at maturity, as in some cataphylls and spines .
Furthermore, several kinds of leaf-like structures found in vascular plants are not totally homologous with them.
Examples include flattened plant stems called phylloclades and cladodes , and flattened leaf stems called phyllodes which differ from leaves both in their structure and origin.
Some structures of non-vascular plants look and function much like leaves.
Examples include the phyllids of mosses and liverworts .
An hour ( symbol : h ; also abbreviated hr .) is a unit of time conventionally reckoned as ​ ⁄ 24 of a day and scientifically reckoned as 3,599–3,601 seconds , depending on conditions.
The hour was initially established in the ancient Near East as a variable measure of ​ ⁄ 12 of the night or daytime .
Such seasonal , temporal , or unequal hours varied by season and latitude .
The hour was subsequently divided into 60 minutes , each of 60 seconds .
Equal or equinoctial hours were taken as ​ ⁄ 24 of the day as measured from noon to noon; the minor seasonal variations of this unit were eventually smoothed by making it ​ ⁄ 24 of the mean solar day .
Since this unit was not constant due to long term variations in the Earth's rotation, the hour was finally separated from the Earth's rotation and defined in terms of the atomic or physical second .
In the modern metric system , hours are an accepted unit of time defined as 3,600 atomic seconds.
However, on rare occasions an hour may incorporate a positive or negative leap second , making it last 3,599 or 3,601 seconds, in order to keep it within 0.9 seconds of UT1 , which is based on measurements of the mean solar day .
The Havel ( German: ˈhaːfl̩ ( listen ) ) is a river in north-eastern Germany, flowing through the German states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , Brandenburg , Berlin and Saxony-Anhalt .
It is a right tributary of the Elbe and 325 kilometres (202 mi) long.
However, the direct distance from its source to its mouth is only 94 kilometres (58 mi).
For much of its length, the Havel is navigable, and it provides an important link in the waterway connections between the east and west of Germany, and beyond.
Jewellery (British English) or jewelry (American English) consists of small decorative items worn for personal adornment , such as brooches , rings , necklaces , earrings , pendants , bracelets , and cufflinks .
Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes.
From a western perspective, the term is restricted to durable ornaments, excluding flowers for example.
For many centuries metal, often combined with gemstones , has been the normal material for jewellery, but other materials such as shells and other plant materials may be used.
It is one of the oldest type of archaeological artefact – with 100,000-year-old beads made from Nassarius shells thought to be the oldest known jewellery.
The basic forms of jewellery vary between cultures but are often extremely long-lived; in European cultures the most common forms of jewellery listed above have persisted since ancient times, while other forms such as adornments for the nose or ankle, important in other cultures, are much less common.
Jewellery may be made from a wide range of materials.
Gemstones and similar materials such as amber and coral , precious metals , beads , and shells have been widely used, and enamel has often been important.
In most cultures jewellery can be understood as a status symbol, for its material properties, its patterns, or for meaningful symbols.
Jewellery has been made to adorn nearly every body part, from hairpins to toe rings , and even genital jewellery .
The patterns of wearing jewellery between the sexes, and by children and older people can vary greatly between cultures, but adult women have been the most consistent wearers of jewellery; in modern European culture the amount worn by adult males is relatively low compared with other cultures and other periods in European culture.
The word jewellery itself is derived from the word jewel , which was anglicised from the Old French jouel , and beyond that, to the Latin word jocale , meaning plaything.
In British English , Indian English , New Zealand English , Hiberno-English , Australian English , and South African English it is spelled jewellery, while the spelling is jewelry in American English .
Both are used in Canadian English , though jewelry prevails by a two to one margin.
In French and a few other European languages the equivalent term, joaillerie , may also cover decorated metalwork in precious metal such as objets d'art and church items, not just objects worn on the person.
Red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet .
It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres .
It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model , and is the complementary color of cyan .
Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson , and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy .
The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering , while the red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre , both forms of iron oxide .
Iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet Mars .
The red color of blood comes from protein hemoglobin , while ripe strawberries , red apples and reddish autumn leaves are colored by anthocyanins .
Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art .
The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories.
It was also an important color in China, where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces.
In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal .
The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes.
Red also became the color of revolution; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, later followed by China, Vietnam, and other communist countries.
Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger and courage.
Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love and joy.
In China, India and many other Asian countries it is the color of symbolizing happiness and good fortune.
To be afraid is to have the emotional response of fear to threats or danger.
Afraid may also refer to:
Kevin ( ) is the anglicized form of the Irish masculine given name Caoimhín ( kiːvʲiːnʲ , Middle Irish : Caoimhghín kəiṽʲʝiːnʲ , Old Irish : Cóemgein koiṽʲɣʲinʲ , Latinized Coemgenus ), composed of Irish caomh (Old Irish cóem ) dear; noble and -gin (Old Irish gein ) birth.
The variant Kevan is anglicized from Caoimheán , an Irish diminutive form.
The feminine version of the name is Caoimhe (anglicised as Keeva or Kweeva ).
Research is creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge , including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.
It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems , or develop new theories .
A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field.
Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports.
To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole.
The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research ) are documentation , discovery , interpretation , or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge.
Approaches to research depend on epistemologies , which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences.
There are several forms of research: scientific , humanities , artistic , economic, social , business, marketing , practitioner research , life, technological , etc.
The scientific study of research practices is known as meta-research .
A defect is a physical, functional, or aesthetic attribute of a product or service that exhibits that the product or service failed to meet one of the desired specifications.
Defect , defects or defected may also refer to:
Bargain may refer to:
Johnny is an English language personal name .
It is usually an affectionate diminutive of the masculine given name John , but since the 16th century, it has sometimes been a given name in its own right for both males and females.
Variant forms of Johnny include: Johnnie, Johnney, Johnni, Johni and Johny .
The masculine Johnny can be rendered into Scottish Gaelic as Seonaidh .
Johnny or Johnnie may refer to:
Fiction broadly refers to any narrative that is derived from the imagination —in other words, not based strictly on history or fact .
It can also refer, more narrowly, to narratives written only in prose (the novel and short story ), and is often used as a synonym for the novel.
In cinema it corresponds to narrative film in opposition to documentary as far as novel to feature film and short story to short film .
A bus (contracted from omnibus , with variants multibus , motorbus , autobus , etc.) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers .
Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers.
The most common type of bus is the single-deck rigid bus , with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses , and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses ; coaches are used for longer-distance services.
Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare.
Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare.
In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special licence above and beyond a regular driver's licence .
Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport , scheduled coach transport , school transport , private hire, or tourism ; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles.
Horse-drawn buses were used from the 1820s, followed by steam buses in the 1830s, and electric trolleybuses in 1882.
The first internal combustion engine buses, or motor buses, were used in 1895.
Recently, interest has been growing in hybrid electric buses , fuel cell buses , and electric buses , as well as buses powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel .
As of the 2010s, bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised , with the same designs appearing around the world.

Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language with signs and symbols.
For languages that utilize a writing system, inscriptions can complement spoken language by creating a durable version of speech that can be stored for future reference or transmitted across distance.
Writing, in other words, is not a language, but a tool used to make languages readable.
Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary , grammar , and semantics , with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols.
The result of writing is called text , and the recipient of text is called a reader .
H.G. Wells argued that writing has the ability to put agreements, laws, commandments on record.
It made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible.
It made a continuous historical consciousness possible.
The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death.
As human societies emerged, collective motivations for the development of writing were driven by pragmatic exigencies like keeping history, maintaining culture , codifying knowledge through curricula and lists of texts deemed to contain foundational knowledge (e.g., The Canon of Medicine ) or artistically exceptional (e.g., a literary canon ), organizing and governing societies through the formation of legal systems , census records, contracts , deeds of ownership, taxation , trade agreements , treaties , and so on.
For example, around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in Mesopotamia outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.
In both ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica , on the other hand, writing may have evolved through calendric and political necessities for recording historical and environmental events.
Individual motivations for writing include improvised additional capacity for the limitations of human memory (e.g., to-do lists, recipes , reminders, logbooks, maps, the proper sequence for a complicated task or important ritual), dissemination of ideas (as in an essay , monograph , broadside , petition , or manifesto ), imaginative narratives and other forms of storytelling , personal or business correspondence , and lifewriting (e.g., a diary or journal).
Transport or transportation is the movement of humans, animals and goods from one location to another.
In other words, the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A to a Point B.
Modes of transport include air , land ( rail and road ), water , cable , pipeline and space .
The field can be divided into infrastructure , vehicles and operations .
Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of civilizations .
Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including roads , railways , airways , waterways , canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports , railway stations , bus stations , warehouses , trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel stations ) and seaports .
Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.
Vehicles traveling on these networks may include automobiles , bicycles , buses , trains , trucks , helicopters , watercraft , spacecraft and aircraft .
Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies.
In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.
Passenger transport may be public , where operators provide scheduled services, or private .
Freight transport has become focused on containerization , although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items.
Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization , but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land .
While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow and restrain urban sprawl .
A day is approximately the period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis.
A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times.
In 1960, the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in year 1900, and was designated the SI base unit of time .
The unit of measurement day, was redefined as 86,400 SI seconds and symbolized d .
In 1967, the second and so the day were redefined by atomic electron transition .
A civil day is usually 86,400 seconds, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time .
Day can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods, reckoned from one midnight to the next, into which a week, month, or year is divided, and corresponding to a rotation of the earth on its axis.
However its use depends on its context, for example when people say 'day and night ', 'day' will have a different meaning.
It will mean the interval of light between two successive nights; the time between sunrise and sunset , in this instance 'day' will mean time of light between one night and the next.
However, in order to be clear when using 'day' in that sense, daytime should be used to distinguish it from day referring to a 24-hour period; this is since daytime usually always means 'the time of the day between sunrise and sunset.
The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date , as in answer to the question, On which day?
The life patterns ( circadian rhythms ) of humans and many other species are related to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle.
Woods or The Woods may refer to:
A playwright or dramatist (rarely dramaturge ) is a person who writes plays .
One such person is William Shakespeare , who lived during both the Tudor and Stuart eras of British history.
Smoking is a practice in which a substance is burned and the resulting smoke breathed in to be tasted and absorbed into the bloodstream .
Most commonly, the substance used is the dried leaves of the tobacco plant, which have been rolled into a small square of rice paper to create a small, round cylinder called a cigarette .
Smoking is primarily practiced as a route of administration for recreational drug use because the combustion of the dried plant leaves vaporizes and delivers active substances into the lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue.
In the case of cigarette smoking these substances are contained in a mixture of aerosol particles and gasses and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid nicotine ; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas into a form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs.
In some cultures, smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals, where participants use it to help induce trance -like states that, they believe, can lead them to spiritual enlightenment .
Smoking generally has negative health effects, because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various physiologic processes such as respiration .
Diseases related to tobacco smoking have been shown to kill approximately half of long-term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by non-smokers.
Smoking caused over five million deaths a year from 1990 to 2015.
Smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use.
Tobacco smoking is the most popular form, being practiced by over one billion people globally, of whom the majority are in the developing countries .
Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium .
Some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics , like heroin , but the use of these is very limited as they are usually not commercially available.
Cigarettes are primarily industrially manufactured but also can be hand-rolled from loose tobacco and rolling paper .
Other smoking implements include pipes , cigars , bidis , hookahs , and bongs .
Smoking can be dated to as early as 5000 BCE, and has been recorded in many different cultures across the world.
Early smoking evolved in association with religious ceremonies; as offerings to deities, in cleansing rituals or to allow shamans and priests to alter their minds for purposes of divination or spiritual enlightenment.
After the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, the practice of smoking tobacco quickly spread to the rest of the world.
In regions like India and Sub-Saharan Africa, it merged with existing practices of smoking (mostly of cannabis).
In Europe, it introduced a new type of social activity and a form of drug intake which previously had been unknown.
Perception surrounding smoking has varied over time and from one place to another: holy and sinful, sophisticated and vulgar, a panacea and deadly health hazard.
In the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries.
This is due to smoking tobacco being among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer , heart attack , COPD , erectile dysfunction , and birth defects .
The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, run ads to discourage use, limit ads that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke.
Mandarin may refer to:
The pupil is a black hole located in the center of the iris of the eye that allows light to strike the retina .
It appears black because light rays entering the pupil are either absorbed by the tissues inside the eye directly, or absorbed after diffuse reflections within the eye that mostly miss exiting the narrow pupil.
The term “pupil” was created by Gerard of Cremona .
In humans, the pupil is round, but other species, such as some cats , have vertical slit pupils, goats have horizontally oriented pupils, and some catfish have annular types.
In optical terms, the anatomical pupil is the eye's aperture and the iris is the aperture stop .
The image of the pupil as seen from outside the eye is the entrance pupil , which does not exactly correspond to the location and size of the physical pupil because it is magnified by the cornea .
On the inner edge lies a prominent structure, the collarette, marking the junction of the embryonic pupillary membrane covering the embryonic pupil.
A bottle is a narrow-necked container made of an impermeable material ( clay , glass , plastic , aluminium etc.) in various shapes and sizes to store and transport liquids ( water , milk , beer , wine , ink , cooking oil , medicine , soft drinks , shampoo , and chemicals , etc.) and whose mouth at the bottling line can be sealed with an internal stopper , an external bottle cap , a closure , or a conductive inner seal using induction sealing .
Some of the earliest bottles appeared in China , Phoenicia , Crete , and Rome .
Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease -causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to the infectious agents and the toxins they produce.
Infectious disease , also known as transmissible disease or communicable disease , is illness resulting from an infection.
Infections are caused by infectious agents ( pathogens ) including:
Hosts can fight infections using their immune system .
Mammalian hosts react to infections with an innate response, often involving inflammation , followed by an adaptive response.
Specific medications used to treat infections include antibiotics , antivirals , antifungals , antiprotozoals , and antihelminthics .
Infectious diseases resulted in 9.2 million deaths in 2013 (about 17% of all deaths).
The branch of medicine that focuses on infections is referred to as infectious disease .
In financial markets , a share is a unit used as mutual funds , limited partnerships , and real estate investment trusts .
The owner of shares in the corporation/company is a shareholder (or stockholder) of the corporation.
A share is an indivisible unit of capital, expressing the ownership relationship between the company and the shareholder.
The denominated value of a share is its face value, and the total of the face value of issued shares represent the capital of a company, which may not reflect the market value of those shares.
The income received from the ownership of shares is a dividend .
The process of purchasing and selling shares often involves going through a stockbroker as a middle man .
There are different types of shares such as equity shares, preference shares, bonus shares, right shares, and employees stock option plan shares.
A sense is a physiological capacity of organisms that provides data for perception .
The senses and their operation, classification, and theory are overlapping topics studied by a variety of fields, most notably neuroscience , cognitive psychology (or cognitive science ), and philosophy of perception .
The nervous system has a specific sensory nervous system , and a sense organ , or sensor , dedicated to each sense.
Humans have a multitude of sensors.
Sight ( vision , visual sense), hearing ( audition , auditory sense), taste ( gustation , gustatory sense), smell ( olfaction , olfactory sense), and touch ( somatosensation , somatosensory sense) are the five traditionally recognized senses.
The ability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by these most broadly recognized senses also exists, and these sensory modalities include temperature ( thermoception ), kinesthetic sense ( proprioception ), pain ( nociception ), balance ( equilibrioception ), vibration ( mechanoreception ), and various internal stimuli (e.g. the different chemoreceptors for detecting salt and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood, or sense of hunger and sense of thirst ).
However, what constitutes a sense is a matter of some debate, leading to difficulties in defining what exactly a distinct sense is, and where the borders lie between responses to related stimuli.
Other animals also have receptors to sense the world around them, with degrees of capability varying greatly between species.
Humans have a comparatively weak sense of smell and a stronger sense of sight relative to many other mammals while some animals may lack one or more of the traditional five senses.
Some animals may also intake and interpret sensory stimuli in very different ways.
Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way that humans cannot, with some species able to sense electrical and magnetic fields , and detect water pressure and currents.
In biology, a population is all the organisms of the same group or species , which live in a particular geographical area , and have the capability of interbreeding.
The area of a sexual population is the area where inter-breeding is potentially possible between any pair within the area, and where the probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability of cross-breeding with individuals from other areas.
In sociology , population refers to a collection of humans .
Demography is a social science which entails the statistical study of human populations.
Population in simpler terms is the number of people in a city or town, region, country or world; population is usually determined by a process called census (a process of collecting, analyzing, compiling and publishing data).
A name is a term used for identification.
Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context.
The entity identified by a name is called its referent .
A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a specific individual human.
The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun .
Other nouns are sometimes called common names or ( obsolete ) general names .
A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name.
Caution must be exercised when translating, for there are ways that one language may prefer one type of name over another.
For example, the French sometimes refer to Aristotle as le Stagirite from one spelling of his place of birth, and English speakers often refer to Shakespeare as The Bard , recognizing him as a paragon writer of the language.
A game is a structured form of play , usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool.
Games are distinct from work , which is usually carried out for remuneration , and from art , which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements.
However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong , solitaire , or some video games ).
Games are sometimes played purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well.
They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals.
The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship .
On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play.
Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.
Key components of games are goals, rules , challenge , and interaction .
Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both.
Many games help develop practical skills , serve as a form of exercise , or otherwise perform an educational , simulational , or psychological role.
Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures.
The Royal Game of Ur , Senet , and Mancala are some of the oldest known games.
Michael is a masculine given name that comes from Hebrew : מִיכָאֵל / מיכאל ( Mīkhāʼēl miχaˈʔel ), derived from the question מי כאל mī kāʼēl , meaning Who is like God?
Patronymic surnames that come from Michael include Carmichael , DiMichele , MacMichael , McMichael , Michaels , Micallef , Michaelson , Michalka , Michels , Mihály , Mikeladze , Mikhaylov , Mikkelsen , Mitchell , Michalski , Mykhaylenko and Mikaelyan .
A chart is a graphical representation of data , in which the data is represented by symbols , such as bars in a bar chart , lines in a line chart , or slices in a pie chart .
A chart can represent tabular numeric data, functions or some kinds of qualitative structure and provides different info.
The term chart as a graphical representation of data has multiple meanings:
Charts are often used to ease understanding of large quantities of data and the relationships between parts of the data.
Charts can usually be read more quickly than the raw data.
They are used in a wide variety of fields, and can be created by hand (often on graph paper ) or by computer using a charting application .
Certain types of charts are more useful for presenting a given data set than others.
For example, data that presents percentages in different groups (such as satisfied, not satisfied, unsure) are often displayed in a pie chart , but may be more easily understood when presented in a horizontal bar chart .
On the other hand, data that represents numbers that change over a period of time (such as annual revenue from 1990 to 2000) might be best shown as a line chart .
Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones (winter does not occur in most of the tropical zone ).
It occurs after autumn and before spring in each year.
Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the Sun .
Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.
When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere , it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere , and vice versa.
In many regions, winter is associated with snow and freezing temperatures.
The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value (that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole).
The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.
The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see earliest and latest sunrise and sunset ).
The somatosensory system is a part of the sensory nervous system .
The somatosensory system is a complex system of sensory neurons and pathways that responds to changes at the surface or inside the body.
The axons (as afferent nerve fibers ) of sensory neurons connect with, or respond to, various receptor cells.
These sensory receptor cells are activated by different stimuli such as heat and nociception , giving a functional name to the responding sensory neuron, such as a thermoreceptor which carries information about temperature changes.
Other types include mechanoreceptors , chemoreceptors , and nociceptors which send signals along a sensory nerve to the spinal cord where they may be processed by other sensory neurons and then relayed to the brain for further processing.
Sensory receptors are found all over the body including the skin , epithelial tissues , muscles , bones and joints , internal organs , and the cardiovascular system .
Somatic senses are sometimes referred to as somesthetic senses , with the understanding that somesthesis includes the sense of touch , proprioception (sense of position and movement), and (depending on usage) haptic perception .
The mapping of the body surfaces in the brain is called somatotopy .
In the cortex, it is also referred to as the cortical homunculus .
This brain-surface (cortical) map is not immutable, however.
Dramatic shifts can occur in response to stroke or injury.
In the broadest definition, a sensor is a device, module, or subsystem whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and send the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor .
A sensor is always used with other electronics.
Sensors are used in everyday objects such as touch-sensitive elevator buttons ( tactile sensor ) and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base, besides innumerable applications of which most people are never aware.
With advances in micromachinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the uses of sensors have expanded beyond the traditional fields of temperature, pressure or flow measurement, for example into MARG sensors .
Moreover, analog sensors such as potentiometers and force-sensing resistors are still widely used.
Applications include manufacturing and machinery, airplanes and aerospace, cars, medicine, robotics and many other aspects of our day-to-day life.
A sensor's sensitivity indicates how much the sensor's output changes when the input quantity being measured changes.
For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1 cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, the sensitivity is 1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope Dy/Dx assuming a linear characteristic).
Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature thermometer inserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer.
Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages.
Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology.
In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly faster measurement time and higher sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches.
Due the increasing demand for rapid, affordable and reliable information in today's world, disposable sensors — low-cost and easy‐to‐use devices for short‐term monitoring or single‐shot measurements — have recently gained growing importance.
Using this class of sensors, critical analytical information can be obtained by anyone, anywhere and at any time, without the need for recalibration and worrying about contamination.

Learning is the process of acquiring new, or modifying existing, knowledge , behaviors , skills , values , or preferences .
The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some machines ; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in some plants.
Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulates from repeated experiences.
The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be lost from that which cannot be retrieved.
Humans learn before birth and continue until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between people and their environment.
The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many fields, including educational psychology , neuropsychology , experimental psychology , and pedagogy .
Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning.
For example, learning may occur as a result of habituation , or classical conditioning , operant conditioning or as a result of more complex activities such as play , seen only in relatively intelligent animals.
Learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness.
Learning that an aversive event can't be avoided nor escaped may result in a condition called learned helplessness .
There is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally , in which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation , indicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in development .
Play has been approached by several theorists as the first form of learning.
Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play.
Lev Vygotsky agrees that play is pivotal for children's development, since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games.
The mind is the set of cognitive faculties including consciousness , imagination , perception , thinking , judgement , language and memory , which is housed in the brain (sometimes including the central nervous system ).
It is usually defined as the faculty of an entity's thoughts and consciousness.
It holds the power of imagination, recognition, and appreciation, and is responsible for processing feelings and emotions, resulting in attitudes and actions.
There is a lengthy tradition in philosophy , religion , psychology , and cognitive science about what constitutes a mind and what are its distinguishing properties.
One open question regarding the nature of the mind is the mind–body problem , which investigates the relation of the mind to the physical brain and nervous system.
Older viewpoints included dualism and idealism , which considered the mind somehow non-physical.
Modern views often center around physicalism and functionalism , which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity , though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters.
Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds (New Scientist 8 September 2018 p10).
For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all animals , by all living things , whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of human-made machines .
Whatever its nature, it is generally agreed that mind is that which enables a being to have subjective awareness and intentionality towards their environment, to perceive and respond to stimuli with some kind of agency , and to have consciousness, including thinking and feeling .
The concept of mind is understood in many different ways by many different cultural and religious traditions.
Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g. panpsychism and animism ), to animals and to deities .
Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with soul or spirit ) to theories concerning both life after death , and cosmological and natural order, for example in the doctrines of Zoroaster , the Buddha , Plato, Aristotle , and other ancient Greek , Indian and, later, Islamic and medieval European philosophers.
Important philosophers of mind include Plato , Patanjali , Descartes , Leibniz , Locke , Berkeley , Hume , Kant , Hegel , Schopenhauer , Searle , Dennett , Fodor , Nagel , and Chalmers .
Psychologists such as Freud and James , and computer scientists such as Turing and Putnam developed influential theories about the nature of the mind.
The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of artificial intelligence , which works closely in relation with cybernetics and information theory to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind.
The mind is also portrayed as the stream of consciousness where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.
A mangrove is a shrub or small tree that grows in coastal saline or brackish water .
The term is also used for tropical coastal vegetation consisting of such species.
Mangroves occur worldwide in the tropics and subtropics , mainly between latitudes 25° N and 25° S .
The total mangrove forest area of the world in 2000 was 137,800 square kilometres (53,200 sq mi), spanning 118 countries and territories.
Mangroves are salt-tolerant trees, also called halophytes , and are adapted to life in harsh coastal conditions.
They contain a complex salt filtration system and complex root system to cope with salt water immersion and wave action.
They are adapted to the low oxygen conditions of waterlogged mud.
The word is used in at least three senses: (1) most broadly to refer to the habitat and entire plant assemblage or mangal , for which the terms mangrove forest biome , and mangrove swamp are also used, (2) to refer to all trees and large shrubs in the mangrove swamp, and (3) narrowly to refer to the mangrove family of plants, the Rhizophoraceae , or even more specifically just to mangrove trees of the genus Rhizophora .
The mangrove biome, or mangal, is a distinct saline woodland or shrubland habitat characterized by depositional coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action.
The saline conditions tolerated by various mangrove species range from brackish water, through pure seawater (3 to 4%), to water concentrated by evaporation to over twice the salinity of ocean seawater (up to 9%).
Mangrove forests move carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into long-term storage in greater quantities than other forests, making them among the planet's best carbon scrubbers according to a NASA-led study based on satellite data.
An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree ( Malus domestica ).
Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus .
The tree originated in Central Asia , where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii , is still found today.
Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists .
Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse , Greek and European Christian traditions .
Apple trees are large if grown from seed.
Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by grafting onto rootstocks , which control the size of the resulting tree.
There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples , resulting in a range of desired characteristics.
Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and use, including cooking , eating raw and cider production.
Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal , bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means.
In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.
Worldwide production of apples in 2017 was 83.1 million tonnes , with China accounting for half of the total.
App or apps may refer to:
A bottle is a narrow-necked container made of an impermeable material ( clay , glass , plastic , aluminium etc.) in various shapes and sizes to store and transport liquids ( water , milk , beer , wine , ink , cooking oil , medicine , soft drinks , shampoo , and chemicals , etc.) and whose mouth at the bottling line can be sealed with an internal stopper , an external bottle cap , a closure , or a conductive inner seal using induction sealing .
Some of the earliest bottles appeared in China , Phoenicia , Crete , and Rome .
In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority.
The term crime does not, in modern criminal law , have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.
The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law ; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law.
One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence ) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society or the state (a public wrong ).
Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.
The notion that acts such as murder , rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide.
What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country.
While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code , in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.
The state ( government ) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime.
In modern societies , there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere.
If found guilty , an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence , or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment , life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions , execution .
Usually, to be classified as a crime, the act of doing something criminal ( actus reus ) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the intention to do something criminal ( mens rea ).
While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.
Breaches of private law ( torts and breaches of contract ) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure .
Skin is the soft outer tissue covering of vertebrates with three main functions: protection, regulation, and sensation.
Other animal coverings , such as the arthropod exoskeleton , have different developmental origin , structure and chemical composition .
The adjective cutaneous means of the skin (from Latin cutis , skin).
In mammals , the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue , and guards the underlying muscles , bones , ligaments and internal organs .
Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians , reptiles , and birds .
All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales , dolphins , and porpoises which appear to be hairless.The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors.
For example, the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss.
Its other functions are insulation , temperature regulation, sensation, and the production of vitamin D folates.
Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue .
This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented.
The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism.
In humans for example, the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick, and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as crows feet and wrinkles.
The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and is the thickest skin on the body.
The speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen .
Fur is dense hair.
Primarily, fur augments the insulation the skin provides but can also serve as a secondary sexual characteristic or as camouflage .
On some animals, the skin is very hard and thick, and can be processed to create leather .
Reptiles and fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection, and birds have hard feathers, all made of tough β- keratins .
Amphibian skin is not a strong barrier, especially regarding the passage of chemicals via skin and is often subject to osmosis and diffusive forces.
For example, a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly, as the chemical diffuses through its skin.
Amphibian skin plays key roles in everyday survival and their ability to exploit a wide range of habitats and ecological conditions.
A generation is all of the people born and living at about the same time, regarded collectively .
It can also be described as, the average period , generally considered to be about thirty years, during which children are born and grow up , become adults, and begin to have children of their own.
In kinship terminology, it is a structural term designating the parent-child relationship.
It is also known as biogenesis , reproduction , or procreation in the biological sciences .
Generation is also often used synonymously with cohort in social science ; under this formulation it means people within a delineated population who experience the same significant events within a given period of time.
Generations in this sense of birth cohort, also known as social generations, are widely used in popular culture, and have been the basis for sociological analysis.
Serious analysis of generations began in the nineteenth century, emerging from an increasing awareness of the possibility of permanent social change and the idea of youthful rebellion against the established social order.
Some analysts believe that a generation is one of the fundamental social categories in a society, while others view its importance as being overshadowed by other factors including class, gender, race, and education, among others.
Maastricht ( , also US : , Dutch: maːˈstrɪxt ( listen ) ; Limburgish (incl.
Maastrichtian ) : Mestreech məˈstʀeˑx ; French : Maestricht (archaic) ; Spanish : Mastrique (archaic) ) is a city and a municipality in the southeast of the Netherlands .
It is the capital and largest city of the province of Limburg .
Maastricht is located on both sides of the Meuse (Dutch: Maas ), at the point where the Jeker joins it.
It is adjacent to the border with Belgium .
Maastricht developed from a Roman settlement to a medieval religious centre.
In the 16th century it became a garrison town and in the 19th century an early industrial city.
Today, the city is a thriving cultural and regional hub.
It became well known through the Maastricht Treaty and as the birthplace of the euro .
Maastricht has 1677 national heritage buildings ( Rijksmonumenten ), the second highest number in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam .
The city is visited by tourists for shopping and recreation, and has a large international student population.
Maastricht is a member of the Most Ancient European Towns Network and is part of the Meuse-Rhine Euroregion , which includes the nearby German and Belgian cities of Aachen , Eupen , Hasselt , Liège , and Tongeren .
The Meuse-Rhine Euroregion is a metropolis with a population of about 3.9 million with several international universities.

Mathematics (from Greek μάθημα máthēma , knowledge, study, learning) includes the study of such topics as quantity ( number theory ), structure ( algebra ), space ( geometry ), and change ( mathematical analysis ).
It has no generally accepted definition .
Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures ; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof .
When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature.
Through the use of abstraction and logic , mathematics developed from counting , calculation , measurement , and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects.
Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist.
The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.
Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics , most notably in Euclid 's Elements .
Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), David Hilbert (1862–1943), and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century , it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions .
Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance , when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.
Mathematics is essential in many fields, including natural science , engineering, medicine, finance, and the social sciences .
Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory .
Mathematicians engage in pure mathematics (mathematics for its own sake) without having any application in mind, but practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.
A parent is a caregiver of the offspring in their own species .
In humans , a parent is the caretaker of a child (where child refers to offspring, not necessarily age).
A biological parent is a person whose gamete resulted in a child, a male through the sperm, and a female through the ovum.
Biological parents are first-degree relatives and have 50% genetic meet.
A female can also become a parent through surrogacy .
Some parents may be adoptive parents, who nurture and raise an offspring, but are not biologically related to the child.
Orphans without adoptive parents can be raised by their grandparents or other family members .
A parent can also be elaborated as an ancestor removed one generation .
With recent medical advances, it is possible to have more than two biological parents.
Examples of third biological parents include instances involving surrogacy or a third person who has provided DNA samples during an assisted reproductive procedure that has altered the recipients' genetic material.
The most common types of parents are mothers, fathers, step-parents, and grandparents.
A mother is, a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth.
The extent to which it is socially acceptable for a parent to be involved in their offspring's life varies from culture to culture, however one that exhibits too little involvement is sometimes said to exhibit child neglect , while one that is too involved is sometimes said to be overprotective , cosseting, nosey , or intrusive .

A recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a dish of prepared food.
The term recipe is also used in medicine or in information technology (e.g., user acceptance ).
A doctor will usually begin a prescription with recipe , Latin for take , usually abbreviated as Rx or the equivalent symbol (℞).
Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts , with about 6,700 undergraduate students and about 15,250 postgraduate students.
Established in 1636 and named for its first benefactor, clergyman John Harvard , Harvard is the United States' oldest institution of higher learning .
Its history, influence, and wealth have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.
The Harvard Corporation , chartered in 1650, is the governing body of Harvard.
The early College primarily trained Congregational and Unitarian clergy, although it has never been formally affiliated with any denomination .
Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century, Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites .
Following the American Civil War , President Charles W.
Eliot 's long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university ; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900.
Lawrence Lowell , who followed Eliot, further reformed the undergraduate curriculum and undertook aggressive expansion of Harvard's land holdings and physical plant.
James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war.
The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College .
The university is organized into eleven separate academic units—ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study —with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area : its 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately 3 miles (5 km) northwest of Boston; the business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium , are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical , dental , and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area .
Harvard's endowment is worth $39.2 billion, making it the largest of any academic institution .
Harvard is a large, highly residential research university.
The nominal cost of attendance is high, but the university's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages.
The Harvard Library is the world's largest academic and private library system, comprising 79 individual libraries holding over 18 million items.
Harvard's alumni include eight U.S. presidents , more than thirty foreign heads of state, 62 living billionaires , 359 Rhodes Scholars , and 242 Marshall Scholars .
As of October 2018 , 158 Nobel laureates , 18 Fields Medalists , and 14 Turing Award winners have been affiliated as students, faculty, or researchers.
In addition, Harvard students and alumni have won 10 Academy Awards , 48 Pulitzer Prizes and 108 Olympic medals (46 gold, 41 silver and 21 bronze) , and have founded a large number of companies worldwide .
Fruit preserves are preparations of fruits , vegetables and sugar , often stored in glass jam jars.
Many varieties of fruit preserves are made globally, including sweet fruit preserves, such as those made from strawberry or apricot , and savory preserves, such as those made from tomatoes or squash .
The ingredients used and how they are prepared determine the type of preserves; jams, jellies, and marmalades are all examples of different styles of fruit preserves that vary based upon the fruit used.
In English, the word, in plural form, preserves is used to describe all types of jams and jellies.
Video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying , playback, broadcasting , and display of moving visual media .
Video was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by cathode ray tube (CRT) systems which were later replaced by flat panel displays of several types.
Video systems vary in display resolution , aspect ratio , refresh rate , color capabilities and other qualities.
Analog and digital variants exist and can be carried on a variety of media, including radio broadcast , magnetic tape , optical discs , computer files , and network streaming .
The sea , the world ocean or simply the ocean is the connected body of salty water that covers over 70% of Earth 's surface (361,132,000 square kilometres (139,434,000 sq mi), with a total volume of roughly 1,332,000,000 cubic kilometres (320,000,000 cu mi)).
It moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle , carbon cycle , and nitrogen cycle .
It has been travelled and explored since ancient times, while the scientific study of the sea— oceanography —dates broadly from the voyages of Captain James Cook to explore the Pacific Ocean between 1768 and 1779.
The word sea is also used to denote smaller, partly landlocked sections of the ocean and certain large, entirely landlocked, saltwater lakes , such as the Caspian Sea and the Dead Sea .
The most abundant solid dissolved in sea water is sodium chloride .
The water also contains salts of magnesium , calcium , and potassium , amongst many other elements, some in minute concentrations.
Salinity varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however, the relative proportions of dissolved salts varies little across the oceans .
Winds blowing over the surface of the sea produce waves , which break when they enter shallow water.
Winds also create surface currents through friction, setting up slow but stable circulations of water throughout the oceans.
The directions of the circulation are governed by factors including the shapes of the continents and Earth's rotation (the Coriolis effect ).
Deep-sea currents, known as the global conveyor belt , carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean.
Tides , the generally twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels , are caused by Earth's rotation and the gravitational effects of the orbiting Moon and, to a lesser extent, of the Sun .
Tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries .
Submarine earthquakes arising from tectonic plate movements under the oceans can lead to destructive tsunamis , as can volcanoes, huge landslides or the impact of large meteorites .
A wide variety of organisms , including bacteria , protists , algae , plants, fungi, and animals, live in the sea, which offers a wide range of marine habitats and ecosystems , ranging vertically from the sunlit surface and shoreline to the great depths and pressures of the cold, dark abyssal zone , and in latitude from the cold waters under polar ice caps to the colourful diversity of coral reefs in tropical regions .
Many of the major groups of organisms evolved in the sea and life may have started there.
The sea provides substantial supplies of food for humans, mainly fish , but also shellfish , mammals and seaweed , whether caught by fishermen or farmed underwater.
Other human uses of the sea include trade , travel, mineral extraction , power generation , warfare , and leisure activities such as swimming , sailing , and scuba diving .
Many of these activities create marine pollution .
The sea is important in human culture, with major appearances in literature at least since Homer 's Odyssey , in marine art , in cinema, in theatre and in classical music.
Symbolically, the sea appears as monsters such as Scylla in mythology and represents the unconscious mind in dream interpretation .
January is the first month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and the first of seven months to have a length of 31 days.
The first day of the month is known as New Year's Day .
It is, on average, the coldest month of the year within most of the Northern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of winter) and the warmest month of the year within most of the Southern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of summer).
In the Southern hemisphere, January is the seasonal equivalent of July in the Northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Ancient Roman observances during this month include Cervula and Juvenalia , celebrated January 1, as well as one of three Agonalia , celebrated January 9, and Carmentalia , celebrated January 11.
These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar
A girl is a young female human , usually a child or an adolescent .
When she becomes an adult, she is described as a woman .
The term girl may also be used to mean a young woman , and is sometimes used as a synonym for daughter .
Girl may also be a term of endearment used by an adult, usually a woman, to designate adult female friends.
The treatment and status of girls in any society is usually closely related to the status of women in that culture.
In cultures where women have a low societal position, girls may be unwanted by their parents, and the state may invest less in services for girls.
Girls' upbringing ranges from being relatively the same as that of boys to complete sex segregation and completely different gender roles .
Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum .
The word usually refers to visible light , which is the visible spectrum that is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight .
Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths).
This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430–750 terahertz (THz).
The main source of light on Earth is the Sun .
Sunlight provides the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly in the form of starches , which release energy into the living things that digest them.
This process of photosynthesis provides virtually all the energy used by living things.
Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire , from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps .
With the development of electric lights and power systems , electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight.
Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called bioluminescence .
For example, fireflies use light to locate mates, and vampire squids use it to hide themselves from prey.
The primary properties of visible light are intensity , propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum , and polarization , while its speed in a vacuum , 299,792,458 metres per second, is one of the fundamental constants of nature.
Visible light, as with all types of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), is experimentally found to always move at this speed in a vacuum.
In physics , the term light sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not.
In this sense, gamma rays , X-rays , microwaves and radio waves are also light.
Like all types of EM radiation, visible light propagates as waves.
However, the energy imparted by the waves is absorbed at single locations the way particles are absorbed.
The absorbed energy of the EM waves is called a photon, and represents the quanta of light.
When a wave of light is transformed and absorbed as a photon, the energy of the wave instantly collapses to a single location, and this location is where the photon arrives.
This is what is called the wave function collapse .
This dual wave-like and particle-like nature of light is known as the wave–particle duality .
The study of light, known as optics , is an important research area in modern physics.
Science (from the Latin word scientia , meaning knowledge) is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe .
The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.
Their contributions to mathematics , astronomy , and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity , whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes.
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age .
The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived natural philosophy , which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions.
The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape; along with the changing of natural philosophy to natural science.
Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology , chemistry , and physics ), which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics , psychology , and sociology ), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic , mathematics , and theoretical computer science ), which study abstract concepts.
There is disagreement, however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence .
Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are described as applied sciences .
Science is based on research , which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies .
The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products , armaments , health care , and environmental protection .
A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity .
The nearest star to Earth is the Sun .
Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth.
Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms , the brightest of which gained proper names.
Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations .
However, most of the estimated 300 sextillion ( 3 × 10 ) stars in the observable universe are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all stars outside our galaxy , the Milky Way .
For at least a portion of its life, a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space .
Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes.
Near the end of its life, a star can also contain degenerate matter .
Astronomers can determine the mass , age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity , and spectrum respectively.
The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate.
Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement.
A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram).
Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.
A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements.
When the stellar core is sufficiently dense, hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through nuclear fusion, releasing energy in the process.
The remainder of the star's interior carries energy away from the core through a combination of radiative and convective heat transfer processes.
The star's internal pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity.
A star with mass greater than 0.4 times the Sun's will expand to become a red giant when the hydrogen fuel in its core is exhausted.
In some cases, it will fuse heavier elements at the core or in shells around the core.
As the star expands it throws a part of its mass, enriched with those heavier elements, into the interstellar environment, to be recycled later as new stars.
Meanwhile, the core becomes a stellar remnant : a white dwarf , a neutron star , or, if it is sufficiently massive, a black hole .
Binary and multi-star systems consist of two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and generally move around each other in stable orbits .
When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their evolution.
Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.
A weed is a plant considered undesirable in a particular situation, a plant in the wrong place.
Examples commonly are plants unwanted in human-controlled settings, such as farm fields , gardens , lawns , and parks .
Taxonomically , the term weed has no botanical significance, because a plant that is a weed in one context is not a weed when growing in a situation where it is in fact wanted, and where one species of plant is a valuable crop plant, another species in the same genus might be a serious weed, such as a wild bramble growing among cultivated loganberries .
In the same way, volunteer crops (plants) are regarded as weeds in a subsequent crop.
Many plants that people widely regard as weeds also are intentionally grown in gardens and other cultivated settings, in which case they are sometimes called beneficial weeds .
The term weed also is applied to any plant that grows or reproduces aggressively, or is invasive outside its native habitat.
More broadly weed occasionally is applied pejoratively to species outside the plant kingdom, species that can survive in diverse environments and reproduce quickly; in this sense it has even been applied to humans .
Weed control is important in agriculture .
Methods include hand cultivation with hoes , powered cultivation with cultivators , smothering with mulch or soil solarization , lethal wilting with high heat, burning , or chemical attack with herbicides .
A spirit is a supernatural being, often, but not exclusively, a non-physical entity ; such as a ghost , fairy , or angel .
In English Bibles , the Spirit (with a capital S), specifically denotes the Holy Spirit .
The concepts of spirit and soul often overlap, and both are believed to survive bodily death in some religions, and spirit can also have the sense of ghost, i.e. a manifestation of the spirit of a deceased person.
Spirit is also often used to refer to the consciousness or personality .
Historically, it was also used to refer to a subtle as opposed to gross material substance, as in the famous last paragraph of Sir Isaac Newton 's Principia Mathematica .
A magazine is a publication , usually a periodical publication , which is printed or electronically published .
This article concerns magazines printed on paper.
Digital or online electronic magazines are covered in a different Wikipedia article.
Magazines are generally published serially on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content .
They are generally financed by advertising , by a purchase price , by prepaid subscriptions , or a combination of the three.
At its root, the word magazine refers to a collection or storage location.
It is a collection of written articles, essays, or stories.
These are often accompanied by photographs or other illustrations.
With some magazines the graphic content may be the primary focus instead of literary or news content.
Magazines typically focus on a single topic or subject: art magazines , car magazines , fashion magazines , literary magazines , news magazines , photography magazines, sports magazines , trade magazines , and other areas (see below).
This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines , artillery magazines , firearm magazines , and, in French, retail stores such as department stores .
A medication (also referred to as medicine , pharmaceutical drug , or simply drug ) is a drug used to diagnose , cure , treat , or prevent disease .
Drug therapy ( pharmacotherapy ) is an important part of the medical field and relies on the science of pharmacology for continual advancement and on pharmacy for appropriate management.
Drugs are classified in various ways.
One of the key divisions is by level of control , which distinguishes prescription drugs (those that a pharmacist dispenses only on the order of a physician , physician assistant , or qualified nurse ) from over-the-counter drugs (those that consumers can order for themselves).
Another key distinction is between traditional small-molecule drugs, usually derived from chemical synthesis , and biopharmaceuticals , which include recombinant proteins , vaccines , blood products used therapeutically (such as IVIG ), gene therapy , monoclonal antibodies and cell therapy (for instance, stem-cell therapies).
Other ways to classify medicines are by mode of action, route of administration , biological system affected, or therapeutic effects .
An elaborate and widely used classification system is the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC system).
The World Health Organization keeps a list of essential medicines .
Drug discovery and drug development are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by pharmaceutical companies , academic scientists, and governments.
As a result of this complex path from discovery to commercialization, partnering has become a standard practice for advancing drug candidates through development pipelines.
Governments generally regulate what drugs can be marketed, how drugs are marketed , and in some jurisdictions, drug pricing.
Controversies have arisen over drug pricing and disposal of used drugs.
Doctor or The Doctor may refer to:
Grants are non-repayable funds or products disbursed or given by one party (grant makers), often a government department, corporation, foundation or trust, to a recipient , often (but not always) a nonprofit entity, educational institution, business or an individual.
In order to receive a grant, some form of Grant Writing often referred to as either a proposal or an application is required.
Most grants are made to fund a specific project and require some level of compliance and reporting.
The grant writing process involves an applicant submitting a proposal (or submission) to a potential funder, either on the applicant's own initiative or in response to a Request for Proposal from the funder.
Other grants can be given to individuals, such as victims of natural disasters or individuals who seek to open a small business .
Sometimes grant makers require grant seekers to have some form of tax-exempt status, be a registered nonprofit organization or a local government.
For example, tiered funding for a freeway are very large grants negotiated at government policy level.
However smaller grants may be provided by a government agency (e.g. municipal government).
Project-related funding involving business, communities, and individuals is often arranged by application either in writing or online.
A prosecutor is a legal representative of the prosecution in countries with either the common law adversarial system , or the civil law inquisitorial system .
The prosecution is the legal party responsible for presenting the case in a criminal trial against an individual accused of breaking the law.
Typically, the prosecutor represents the government in the case brought against the accused person.
A referendum (plural: referendums or less commonly referenda ) is a direct vote in which an entire electorate is invited to vote on a particular proposal.
This may result in the adoption of a new law.
In some countries, it is synonymous with a plebiscite or a vote on a ballot question .
Some definitions of 'plebiscite' suggest it is a type of vote to change the constitution or government of a country.
The word, 'referendum' is often a catchall, used for both legislative referrals and initiatives .
Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution and 'plebiscite' as a vote which does not affect the constitution.
whereas in Ireland, 'plebiscite' referred to the vote to adopt its constitution, but a subsequent vote to amend the constitution is called a 'referendum', as is a poll of the electorate on a non-constitutional bill.
Imagery , in a literary text, is an author's use of vivid and descriptive language to add depth to their work.
It appeals to human senses to deepen the reader's understanding of the work.
Powerful forms of imagery engage all of the senses.
Nursing is a profession within the health care sector focused on the care of individuals, families, and communities so they may attain, maintain, or recover optimal health and quality of life .
Nurses may be differentiated from other health care providers by their approach to patient care , training , and scope of practice .
Nurses practice in many specialties with differing levels of prescription authority .
Many nurses provide care within the ordering scope of physicians , and this traditional role has shaped the public image of nurses as care providers.
However, nurse practitioners are permitted by most jurisdictions to practice independently in a variety of settings.
Since the postwar period, nurse education has undergone a process of diversification towards advanced and specialized credentials , and many of the traditional regulations and provider roles are changing.
Nurses develop a plan of care, working collaboratively with physicians, therapists, the patient, the patient's family and other team members, that focuses on treating illness to improve quality of life.
In the United States and the United Kingdom, advanced practice nurses, such as clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners, diagnose health problems and prescribe medications and other therapies, depending on individual state regulations.
Nurses may help coordinate the patient care performed by other members of a multidisciplinary health care team such as therapists, medical practitioners and dietitians.
Nurses provide care both interdependently, for example, with physicians, and independently as nursing professionals.
In product development and process optimization , a requirement is a singular documented physical or functional need that a particular design, product or process aims to satisfy.
It is commonly used in a formal sense in engineering design , including for example in systems engineering , software engineering , or enterprise engineering .
It is a broad concept that could speak to any necessary (or sometimes desired) function, attribute, capability, characteristic, or quality of a system for it to have value and utility to a customer, organization, internal user, or other stakeholder.
Requirements can come with different levels of specificity; for example, a requirement specification or requirement spec (often imprecisely referred to as the spec/specs, but there are actually different sorts of specifications) refers to an explicit, highly objective/clear (and often quantitative) requirement (or sometimes, set of requirements ) to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service.
A set of requirements is used as inputs into the design stages of product development .
Requirements are also an important input into the verification process, since tests should trace back to specific requirements.
Requirements show what elements and functions are necessary for the particular project.
When iterative methods of software development or agile methods are used, the system requirements are incrementally developed in parallel with design and implementation.
With the waterfall model requirements are developed before design and implementation.
Truth is most often used to mean being in accord with fact or reality , or fidelity to an original or standard.
Truth is also sometimes defined in modern contexts as an idea of truth to self, or authenticity .
Truth is usually held to be opposite to falsehood , which, correspondingly, can also suggest a logical, factual, or ethical meaning.
The concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, and science.
Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most of the sciences , law , journalism , and everyday life.
Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself.
To some, truth is viewed as the correspondence of language or thought to an independent reality , in what is sometimes called the correspondence theory of truth .
Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians.
Language is a means by which humans convey information to one another.
The method used to determine whether something is a truth is termed a criterion of truth .
There are varying stances on such questions as what constitutes truth: what things are truthbearers capable of being true or false; how to define, identify, and distinguish truth; what roles do faith and empirical knowledge play; and whether truth can be subjective or is objective : relative truth versus absolute truth.
In botany , a fruit is the seed -bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering .
Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds .
Edible fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition ; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.
Accordingly, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate ) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.
In common language usage, fruit normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state, such as apples , bananas , grapes , lemons , oranges , and strawberries .
On the other hand, in botanical usage, fruit includes many structures that are not commonly called fruits, such as bean pods, corn kernels , tomatoes , and wheat grains.
The section of a fungus that produces spores is also called a fruiting body.
Hack may refer to:
Quadrant may refer to:
Minutes , also known as minutes of meeting (abbreviation MoM ), protocols or, informally, notes , are the instant written record of a meeting or hearing .
They typically describe the events of the meeting and may include a list of attendees, a statement of the issues considered by the participants, and related responses or decisions for the issues.
Turtles are diapsids of the order Testudines (or Chelonii ) characterized by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs and acting as a shield .
Turtle may refer to the order as a whole (American English) or to fresh-water and sea-dwelling testudines (British English).
The order Testudines includes both extant (living) and extinct species.
The earliest known members of this group date from the Middle Jurassic , making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than snakes or crocodilians .
Of the 356 known species alive today, some are highly endangered .
Turtles are ectotherms —animals commonly called cold-blooded —meaning that their internal temperature varies according to the ambient environment.
However, because of their high metabolic rate, leatherback sea turtles have a body temperature that is noticeably higher than that of the surrounding water.
Turtles are classified as amniotes , along with other reptiles, birds, and mammals.
Like other amniotes, turtles breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around water.
The study of turtles is called cheloniology , after the Greek word for turtle.
It is also sometimes called testudinology, after the Latin name for turtles.
Feeling is the nominalization of the verb to feel .
The word was first used in the English language to describe the physical sensation of touch through either experience or perception .
The word is also used to describe experiences other than the physical sensation of touch, such as a feeling of warmth and of sentience in general.
In Latin , sentire meant to feel, hear or smell.In psychology, the word is usually reserved for the conscious subjective experience of emotion.
Phenomenology and heterophenomenology are philosophical approaches that provide some basis for knowledge of feelings.
Many schools of psychotherapy depend on the therapist achieving some kind of understanding of the client's feelings, for which methodologies exist.
Perception of the physical world does not necessarily result in a universal reaction among receivers (see emotions ), but varies depending upon one's tendency to handle the situation, how the situation relates to the receiver's past experiences, and any number of other factors.
Feelings are also known as a state of consciousness, such as that resulting from emotions, sentiments or desires.
People buy products in hopes that the product will make them feel a certain way: either happy, excited or beautiful.
Or, they find the product useful in some way, even indirectly such as to support a charity or for altruistic economic reasons.
Some people buy beauty products in hopes of achieving a state of happiness or a sense of self beauty or as an act or expression of beauty.
Past events are used in our lives to form schemas in our minds, and based on those past experiences, we expect our lives to follow a certain script.
However, storytelling, commemoration and reservation of commemoration (the unwillingness to overtly impose remembrances), research and investigation, and many other activities can help settle uneasy feelings without scripting, without the ambivalence that feeling can only be handled by proxy, which is not always true.
A social psychologist, Daniel Gilbert , conducted a study on the influence of feelings on events alongside other researchers.
The results showed that when the participants predicted a positive feeling for an event, the higher the chances that they wanted to relive the event.
Predicted feelings were either short-lived or did not correlate to what the participant expected.
February is the second and shortest month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendar with 28 days in common years and 29 days in leap years , with the quadrennial 29th day being called the leap day .
It is the first of five months to have a length of fewer than 31 days (the other four months that fall under this category are: April, June, September, and November), and the only month to have a length of fewer than 30 days, with the other seven months having 31 days.
In 2019, February had 28 days.
February is the third and last month of meteorological winter in the Northern Hemisphere .
In the Southern Hemisphere , February is the third and last month of summer (the seasonal equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, in meteorological reckoning).
A century is a period of 100 years .
Centuries are numbered ordinally in English and many other languages.
The word century comes from the Latin centum , meaning one hundred .
Century is sometimes abbreviated as c.
A centenary is a hundredth anniversary, or a celebration of this, typically the remembrance of an event which took place a hundred years earlier.
A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations.
The term is derived from the Old French conté or cunté denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count ( earl ) or a viscount .
The modern French is comté , and its equivalents in other languages are contea , contado , comtat , condado , Grafschaft , graafschap , Gau , etc.
conte , comte , conde , Graf ).
When the Normans conquered England , they brought the term with them.
The Saxons had already established the districts that became the historic counties of England , calling them shires ; many county names derive from the name of the county town ( county seat ) with the word shire added on: for example, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire .
The Anglo-Saxon terms earl and earldom were taken as equivalent to the continental terms count and county under the conquering Normans, and over time the two blended and became equivalent.
Further, the later-imported term became a synonym for the native English word scir ( ʃiːr ) or, in Modern English , shire .
Since a shire was an administrative division of the kingdom , the term county evolved to designate an administrative division of a federal state , as in Germany and the United States , or of a national government in most other modern uses.
In the United States and Canada , founded 600 years later on the British traditions, counties are usually an administrative division set by convenient geographical demarcations, which in governance have certain officeholders ( e.g. , sheriffs and their departments ) as a part of the state and provincial mechanisms, including geographically common court systems .
A county may be further subdivided into districts, hundreds , townships or other administrative jurisdictions within the county.
A county usually, but not always, contains cities , towns , townships , villages , or other municipal corporations , which in most cases are somewhat subordinate or dependent upon county governments.
Depending on the nation, municipality , and local geography, municipalities may or may not be subject to direct or indirect county control—the functions of both levels are often consolidated into a city government when the area is densely populated.
Outside English-speaking countries , an equivalent of the term county is often used to describe subnational jurisdictions that are structurally equivalent to counties in the relationship they have with their national government; but which may not be administratively equivalent to counties in predominantly English-speaking countries.
Trend , trending , or trends may refer to:
In physics , sound is a vibration that typically propagates as an audible wave of pressure, through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid.
In human physiology and psychology , sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain .
Humans can only hear sound waves as distinct pitches when the frequency lies between about 20 Hz and 20 kHz. Sound waves above 20 kHz are known as ultrasound and is not perceptible by humans.
Sound waves below 20 Hz are known as infrasound .
Different animal species have varying hearing ranges .
Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services).
Simply put, it is any activity or enterprise entered into for profit.
It does not mean it is a company, a corporation, partnership, or have any such formal organization, but it can range from a street peddler to General Motors.
Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business.
If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions.
A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates.
The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.
The term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a company .
A company, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability , as well as corporate tax rates.
A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.
A name is a term used for identification.
Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context.
The entity identified by a name is called its referent .
A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a specific individual human.
The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun .
Other nouns are sometimes called common names or ( obsolete ) general names .
A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name.
Caution must be exercised when translating, for there are ways that one language may prefer one type of name over another.
For example, the French sometimes refer to Aristotle as le Stagirite from one spelling of his place of birth, and English speakers often refer to Shakespeare as The Bard , recognizing him as a paragon writer of the language.
A brick is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction.
Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay , but it is now used to denote rectangular units made of clay-bearing soil, sand, and lime , or concrete materials.
Bricks can be joined together using mortar , adhesives or by interlocking them.
Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities.
Two basic categories of bricks are fired and non-fired bricks.
Block is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials, but is usually larger than a brick.
Lightweight bricks (also called lightweight blocks) are made from expanded clay aggregate .
Fired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest building materials , sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since circa 4000 BC.
Air-dried bricks, also known as mudbricks , have a history older than fired bricks, and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw.
Bricks are laid in courses and numerous patterns known as bonds , collectively known as brickwork , and may be laid in various kinds of mortar to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure.
Uncle (from Latin : avunculus the diminutive of avus grandfather) is a male family relationship or kinship within an extended or immediate family.
Uncles are second-degree relatives and share 25% genetic overlap when they are the full brother of one of the biological parents.
An uncle is the brother of one's parent.
A half-uncle is the half-brother of one's parent.
Uncle-in-law can refer to the husband of one's aunt (sister of one's parent) or uncle of one's spouse.
A biological uncle is a second degree male relative and shares 25% genetic overlap.
However people who are not a biological uncle are sometimes affectionately called as an uncle as a title of admiration and respect.
A woman with the equivalent relationship of an uncle is an aunt .
The reciprocal relationship to both of these is that of a nephew or niece .
A grand-uncle or granduncle or great-uncle is the brother of one's grandparent.
Half-great-uncle or half-granduncle is the half-brother of one's grandparent.
Great-uncle-in-law or granduncle-in-law is the husband of one's great-aunt or grandaunt (sister of one's grandparent).
Great-uncle-in-law or granduncle-in-law and can also be great-uncle or granduncle of one's spouse.
A great-great-uncle or great-granduncle is the brother of one's great-grandparent.
A half-great-great-uncle or half-great-granduncle is the half-brother of one's great-grandparent.
A cousin-uncle is the male cousin of one's parent.
As they are in first degree relatives to your parents they become a second degree relative to you as you are the generation below your parents.
They are called uncle simply because they lie a generation above you.
Their child would be called in reference to yourself, your second cousin as they are on your generation level.
West is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass .
It is the opposite direction from east .
Lego ( LEG -oh , Danish: ˈleːko ; stylised as LEGO ) is a line of plastic construction toys that are manufactured by The Lego Group , a privately held company based in Billund , Denmark .
The company's flagship product, Lego, consists of colourful interlocking plastic bricks accompanying an array of gears, figurines called minifigures , and various other parts.
Lego pieces can be assembled and connected in many ways to construct objects, including vehicles, buildings, and working robots.
Anything constructed can be taken apart again, and the pieces reused to make new things.
The Lego Group began manufacturing the interlocking toy bricks in 1949.
Movies, games, competitions, and six Legoland amusement parks have been developed under the brand.
As of July 2015, 600 billion Lego parts had been produced.
In February 2015, Lego replaced Ferrari as Brand Finance 's world's most powerful brand.
Voting is a method for a group, such as a meeting or an electorate , in order to make a collective decision or express an opinion, usually following discussions, debates or election campaigns .
Democracies elect holders of high office by voting.
Residents of a place represented by an elected official are called constituents, and those constituents who cast a ballot for their chosen candidate are called voters.
There are different systems for collecting votes.

Management (or managing ) is the administration of an organization , whether it is a business , a not-for-profit organization, or government body.
Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees (or of volunteers) to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources , such as financial , natural , technological , and human resources .
The term management may also refer to those people who manage an organization.
Social scientists study management as an academic discipline , investigating areas such as social organization and organizational leadership .
Some people study management at colleges or universities; major degrees in management include the Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.) Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA.) Master of Business Administration (MBA.) and, for the public sector, the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree.
Individuals who aim to become management specialists or experts, management researchers, or professors may complete the Doctor of Management (DM), the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), or the PhD in Business Administration or Management.
There has recently been a movement for evidence-based management .
Larger organizations generally have three levels of managers, which are typically organized in a hierarchical , pyramid structure:
In smaller organizations, an individual manager may have a much wider scope.
A single manager may perform several roles or even all of the roles commonly observed in a large organization.
Interaction is a kind of action that occur as two or more objects have an effect upon one another.
The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way causal effect.
A closely related term is interconnectivity , which deals with the interactions of interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising emergent phenomena.
Interaction has different tailored meanings in various sciences .
Changes can also involve interaction.
Casual examples of interaction outside science include:
In religion and folklore , Hell is an afterlife location in which evil souls are subjected to punitive suffering, often torture as eternal punishment after death.
Religions with a linear divine history often depict hells as eternal destinations, the biggest examples of which are Christianity and Islam , whereas religions with reincarnation usually depict a hell as an intermediary period between incarnations , as is the case in the dharmic religions .
Religions typically locate hell in another dimension or under Earth 's surface.
Other afterlife destinations include Heaven , Paradise , Purgatory , Limbo , and the underworld .
Other religions, which do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward, merely describe an abode of the dead, the grave , a neutral place that is located under the surface of Earth (for example, see Kur , Hades , and Sheol ).
Such places are sometimes equated with the English word 'hell', though a more correct translation would be 'underworld' or 'world of the dead'.
The ancient Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, and Finnic religions include entrances to the underworld from the land of the living.
A typewriter is a mechanical or electromechanical machine for writing characters similar to those produced by printer's movable type .
Typically, a typewriter has an array of keys , and pressing one causes a different single character to be produced on the paper, by causing a ribbon with dried ink to be struck against the paper by a type element similar to the sorts used in movable type letterpress printing .
Commonly, a separate type element (called a typebar) corresponds to each key, but the mechanism may also use a single type element (such as a typeball) with a different portion of it used for each possible character.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the term typewriter was also applied to a person who used a typing machine.
The first commercial typewriters were introduced in 1874, but did not become common in offices until after the mid-1880s.
The typewriter quickly became an indispensable tool for practically all writing other than personal handwritten correspondence.
It was widely used by professional writers, in offices, and for business correspondence in private homes.
Typewriters were a standard fixture in most offices up to the 1980s.
Thereafter, they began to be largely supplanted by the computer.
Nevertheless, typewriters remain common in some parts of the world, are required for a few specific applications, and are popular in certain subcultures.
In many Indian cities and towns, typewriters are still used, especially in road side and legal offices due to a lack of continuous, reliable electricity.
The QWERTY keyboard continues to be the standard used in computers too.
Notable typewriter manufacturers included E.
Remington and Sons , IBM , Godrej , Imperial Typewriter Company , Oliver Typewriter Company , Olivetti , Royal Typewriter Company , Smith Corona , Underwood Typewriter Company , Adler Typewriter Company and Olympia Werke de .
Printer or Printers may refer to:
Orders is a surname .
Youth is the time of life when one is young, and often means the time between childhood and adulthood ( maturity ).
It is also defined as the appearance, freshness, vigor, spirit, etc., characteristic of one who is young.
Its definitions of a specific age range varies, as youth is not defined chronologically as a stage that can be tied to specific age ranges; nor can its end point be linked to specific activities, such as taking unpaid work or having sexual relations without consent.
Youth is an experience that may shape an individual's level of dependency, which can be marked in various ways according to different cultural perspectives.
Personal experience is marked by an individual's cultural norms or traditions, while a youth's level of dependency means the extent to which they still rely on their family emotionally and economically.
Protocol may refer to:
Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality , rhythm , and a variety of vocal techniques.
A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist (in jazz and popular music ).
Singers perform music ( arias , recitatives , songs , etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments .
Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists.
Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band .
Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera , Indian music and religious music styles such as gospel , traditional music styles, world music , jazz , blues , gazal and popular music styles such as pop , rock , electronic dance music and filmi (film songs).
Singing can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised.
It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort or ritual, as part of music education or as a profession.
Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction and regular practice .
If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong.
Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre , such as classical or rock , although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre).
They usually take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers.

Autumn , also known as fall in American English and sometimes in Canadian English, is one of the four temperate seasons .
Autumn marks the transition from summer to winter , in September ( Northern Hemisphere ) or March ( Southern Hemisphere ), when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably.
One of its main features in temperate climates is the shedding of leaves from deciduous trees .
Some cultures regard the autumnal equinox as mid-autumn, while others with a longer temperature lag treat it as the start of autumn.
Meteorologists (and most of the temperate countries in the southern hemisphere) use a definition based on Gregorian calendar months, with autumn being September, October, and November in the northern hemisphere, and March, April, and May in the southern hemisphere.
In North America , autumn traditionally starts on September 21 and ends on December 21.
It is considered to start with the September equinox (21 to 24 September) and end with the winter solstice (21 or 22 December).
Popular culture in the United States associates Labor Day , the first Monday in September, as the end of summer and the start of autumn; certain summer traditions, such as wearing white, are discouraged after that date.
As daytime and nighttime temperatures decrease, trees shed their leaves.
In traditional East Asian solar term , autumn starts on or around 8 August and ends on or about 7 November.
In Ireland , the autumn months according to the national meteorological service, Met Éireann , are September, October and November.
However, according to the Irish Calendar , which is based on ancient Gaelic traditions, autumn lasts throughout the months of August, September and October, or possibly a few days later, depending on tradition.
The names of the months in Manx Gaelic are similarly based on autumn covering August, September and October.
In Argentina , Australia and New Zealand , autumn officially begins on 1 March and ends on 31 May.
Show may refer to:
A daughter is a female offspring - a girl or woman in relation to her parents .
Daughterhood is the state of being someone's daughter.
The male counterpart is a son .
Analogously the name is used in several areas to show relations between groups or elements.
The word daughter also has several other connotations attached to it, one of these being used in reference to female descendancy or consanguinity .
It can also be used as a term of endearment coming from an elder.
In patriarchal societies, daughters often have different or lesser familial rights than sons.
A family may prefer to have sons rather than daughters and subject daughters to female infanticide .
In some societies it is the custom for a daughter to be 'sold' to her husband, who must pay a bride price .
The reverse of this custom, where the parents pay the husband a sum of money to compensate for the financial burden of the woman, is found in societies where women do not labour outside the home, and is referred to as dowry .
The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state to enforce the law , to protect the lives, liberty and possessions of citizens, and to prevent crime and civil disorder .
Their lawful powers include arrest and the legitimized use of force .
The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility.
Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing.
Police forces are usually public sector services, funded through taxes.
Law enforcement is only part of policing activity.
Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order.
In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property .
Police forces have become ubiquitous in modern societies.
Nevertheless, their role can be controversial, as some are involved to varying degrees in corruption , police brutality and the enforcement of authoritarian rule .
A police force may also be referred to as a police department, police service, constabulary , gendarmerie , crime prevention , protective services, law enforcement agency , civil guard or civic guard .
Members may be referred to as police officers , troopers , sheriffs , constables , rangers , peace officers or civic/civil guards.
Ireland differs from other English-speaking countries by using the Irish language terms Garda (singular) and Gardaí (plural), for both the national police force and its members.
The word police is the most universal and similar terms can be seen in many non-English speaking countries.
Numerous slang terms exist for the police.
Many slang terms for police officers are decades or centuries old with lost etymology.
One of the oldest, cop, has largely lost its slang connotations and become a common colloquial term used both by the public and police officers to refer to their profession.
Fish are gill -bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits .
They form a sister group to the tunicates , together forming the olfactores .
Included in this definition are the living hagfish , lampreys , and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups.
Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes , so cladistically they are fish as well.
However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry).
Because in this manner the term fish is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology , unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods.
The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes ) is considered a typological , but not a phylogenetic classification.
The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period.
Although they lacked a true spine , they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts.
Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms.
Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators.
The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks ) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods .
Most fish are ectothermic (cold-blooded), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature .
Fish can communicate in their underwater environments through the use of acoustic communication.
Acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another.
The production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.
The sounds emitted by fish can vary depending on the species and stimulus involved.
They can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder.
Fish are abundant in most bodies of water.
They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon ) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish ), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of the ocean.
With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.
Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially as food .
Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing) or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture ).
They are also caught by recreational fishers , kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers , and exhibited in public aquaria .
Fish have had a role in culture through the ages, serving as deities , religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.
A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun .
Due to the Earth's axial tilt , the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons , marked by change in weather , the hours of daylight , and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility .In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring , summer , autumn , and winter .
In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics , the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked.
A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period as counted in a given calendar .
The Gregorian calendar , or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars ; see below .
For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days.
The ISO standard ISO 80000-3 , Annex C, supports the symbol a (for Latin annus ) to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days.
In English, the abbreviations y and yr are commonly used.
In astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time ; it is defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds ( SI base unit ), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.
The word year is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the seasonal year , the fiscal year , the academic year , etc.
Similarly, year can mean the orbital period of any planet ; for example, a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit.
The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the Great Year .
Seconds are the base units of time in the International System of Units (SI).
Seconds may also refer to:
An opinion is a judgment, viewpoint, or statement that is not conclusive.
Data is a set of values of subjects with respect to qualitative or quantitative variables .
Data and information or knowledge are often used interchangeably; however data becomes information when it is viewed in context or in post-analysis.
While the concept of data is commonly associated with scientific research , data is collected by a huge range of organizations and institutions, including businesses (e.g., sales data, revenue, profits, stock price ), governments (e.g., crime rates , unemployment rates , literacy rates) and non-governmental organizations (e.g., censuses of the number of homeless people by non-profit organizations).
Data is measured , collected and reported , and analyzed , whereupon it can be visualized using graphs, images or other analysis tools.
Data as a general concept refers to the fact that some existing information or knowledge is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing .
Raw data (unprocessed data) is a collection of numbers or characters before it has been cleaned and corrected by researchers.
Raw data needs to be corrected to remove outliers or obvious instrument or data entry errors (e.g., a thermometer reading from an outdoor Arctic location recording a tropical temperature).
Data processing commonly occurs by stages, and the processed data from one stage may be considered the raw data of the next stage.
Field data is raw data that is collected in an uncontrolled in situ environment.
Experimental data is data that is generated within the context of a scientific investigation by observation and recording.
Data has been described as the new oil of the digital economy .
Shame is an unpleasant self-conscious emotion typically associated with a negative evaluation of the self, withdrawal motivations, and feelings of distress, exposure, mistrust, powerlessness, and worthlessness.
Noise is unwanted sound judged to be unpleasant, loud or disruptive to hearing .
From a physics standpoint, noise is indistinguishable from sound, as both are vibrations through a medium, such as air or water.
The difference arises when the brain receives and perceives a sound.
Acoustic noise is any sound in the acoustic domain, either deliberate (e.g., music or speech) or unintended.
In contrast, noise in electronics may not be audible to the human ear and may require instruments for detection.
In audio engineering , noise can refer to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as a hiss.
This signal noise is commonly measured using A-weighting or ITU-R 468 weighting .
In experimental sciences , noise can refer to any random fluctuations of data that hinders perception of a signal.
A parody ( ); also called a spoof , send-up , take-off , lampoon , play on (something) , caricature , or joke , is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an original work —its subject, author, style, or some other target—by means of satiric or ironic imitation .
As the literary theorist Linda Hutcheon puts it, parody ...
is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text.
Another critic, Simon Dentith, defines parody as any cultural practice which provides a relatively polemical allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice.
Parody may be found in art or culture, including literature , music (although parody in music has an earlier, somewhat different meaning than for other art forms), animation , gaming , and film .
The writer and critic John Gross observes in his Oxford Book of Parodies , that parody seems to flourish on territory somewhere between pastiche (a composition in another artist's manner, without satirical intent) and burlesque (which fools around with the material of high literature and adapts it to low ends).
Meanwhile, the Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot distinguishes between the parody and the burlesque, A good parody is a fine amusement, capable of amusing and instructing the most sensible and polished minds; the burlesque is a miserable buffoonery which can only please the populace.
Historically, when a formula grows tired, as in the case of the moralistic melodramas in the 1910s, it retains value only as a parody, as demonstrated by the Buster Keaton shorts that mocked that genre.
A number is a mathematical object used to count , measure , and label .
The original examples are the natural numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and so forth.
A written symbol like 5 that represents a number is called a numeral.
A numeral system is an organized way to write and manipulate this type of symbol, for example the Hindu–Arabic numeral system allows combinations of numerical digits like 5 and 0 to represent larger numbers like 50.
A numeral in linguistics can refer to a symbol like 5, the words or phrase that names a number, like five hundred, or other words that mean a specific number, like dozen.
In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers ), for ordering (as with serial numbers ), and for codes (as with ISBNs ).
In common usage, number may refer to a symbol, a word or phrase, or the mathematical object.
In mathematics , the notion of number has been extended over the centuries to include 0 , negative numbers , rational numbers such as 1 / 2 and − 2 / 3 , real numbers such as √ 2 and π , and complex numbers , which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by addition and multiplication).
Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations , the most familiar being addition , subtraction , multiplication , division , and exponentiation .
Their study or usage is called arithmetic .
The same term may also refer to number theory , the study of the properties of numbers.
Besides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world.
For example, in Western society, the number 13 is regarded as unlucky, and a million may signify a lot.
Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience , belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology , permeated ancient and medieval thought.
Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics , stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.
During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers and may be seen as extending the concept.
Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers , which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system.
Today, number systems are considered important special examples of much more general categories such as rings and fields , and the application of the term number is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.
Matriarchy is a social system in which females (most notably in mammals) hold the primary power positions in roles of political leadership, moral authority , social privilege and control of property at the specific exclusion of males — at least to a large degree.
While those definitions apply in general English, definitions specific to the disciplines of anthropology and feminism differ in some respects.
Most anthropologists hold that there are no known anthropological societies that are unambiguously matriarchal , but some authors believe exceptions may exist or may have.
Matriarchies may also be confused with matrilineal , matrilocal , and matrifocal societies.
A few people consider any non- patriarchal system to be matriarchal, thus including genderally equalitarian systems ( Peggy Reeves Sanday favors redefining and reintroducing the word matriarchy, especially in reference to contemporary matrilineal societies such as the Minangkabau ), but most academics exclude them from matriarchies strictly defined.
In 19th-century Western scholarship, the hypothesis of matriarchy representing an early, mainly prehistoric, stage of human development gained popularity.
Possibilities of so-called primitive societies were cited and the hypothesis survived into the 20th century, including in the context of second-wave feminism .
This hypothesis was criticized by some authors such as Cynthia Eller in The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory and remains as a largely unsolved question to this day.
Some older myths describe matriarchies.
Several modern feminists have advocated for matriarchy now or in the future and it has appeared in feminist literature .
In several theologies, matriarchy has been portrayed as negative.
An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy .
Heat engines , like the internal combustion engine , burn a fuel to create heat which is then used to do work .
Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, pneumatic motors use compressed air , and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy .
In biological systems, molecular motors , like myosins in muscles , use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion.
Keystroke logging , often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing , is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard , typically covertly, so that person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored.
Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program.
A keylogger can be either software or hardware .
While the programs themselves are legal, with many of them being designed to allow employers to oversee the use of their computers, keyloggers are most often used for the purpose of stealing passwords and other confidential information.
Keylogging can also be used to study human–computer interaction.
Numerous keylogging methods exist: they range from hardware and software-based approaches to acoustic analysis.
A lawyer or attorney is a person who practices law , as an advocate , attorney , attorney at law , barrister , barrister-at-law , bar-at-law , canonist , canon lawyer, civil law notary , counsel , counselor, counsellor, solicitor , legal executive , or public servant preparing, interpreting and applying law, but not as a paralegal or charter executive secretary .
Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services.
The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.
A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students (or pupils) under the direction of teachers.
Most countries have systems of formal education , which is commonly compulsory .
In these systems, students progress through a series of schools.
The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education.
An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university , but these higher education institutions are usually not compulsory.
In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (Elementary in the US) and secondary (Middle school in the US) education.
Kindergarten or pre-school provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5).
University , vocational school , college or seminary may be available after secondary school.
A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or a school of dance.
Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.
There are also non-government schools, called private schools.
Private schools may be required when the government does not supply adequate, or special education.
Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools , madrasa , hawzas (Shi'a schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements.
Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training , military education and training and business schools .
In home schooling and online schools , teaching and learning take place outside a traditional school building.
Schools are commonly organized in several different organizational models , including departmental, small learning communities, academies, integrated, and schools-within-a-school.

The United States of America ( USA ), commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country comprising 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions .
At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km ), the United States is the world's third or fourth largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe 's 3.9 million square miles (10.1 million km ).
With a population of over 327 million people, the U.S. is the third most populous country .
The capital is Washington, D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City .
Most of the country is located contiguously in North America between Canada and Mexico .
Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago.
European colonization began in the 16th century.
The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast .
Following the French and Indian War , numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution , which began in 1775, and the subsequent Declaration of Independence in 1776.
The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a European power .
The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights , being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties .
The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, acquiring new territories , displacing Native American tribes , and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848.
During the second half of the 19th century, the Civil War led to the abolition of slavery .
By the end of the century, the United States had extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution , began to soar.
The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power.
The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower , the first country to develop nuclear weapons , the only country to use them in warfare , and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council .
Sweeping civil rights legislation, notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 , outlawed discrimination based on race or color.
During the Cold War , the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race , culminating with the 1969 U.S. Moon landing .
The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower .
The United States is the world's oldest surviving federation .
It is a federal republic and a representative democracy .
The United States is a founding member of the United Nations , World Bank , International Monetary Fund , Organization of American States (OAS), and other international organizations.
The United States is a highly developed country , with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP , accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP.
The U.S. economy is largely post-industrial , characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world.
The United States is the world's largest importer and the second largest exporter of goods, by value.
Although its population is only 4.3% of the world total, the U.S. holds 31% of the total wealth in the world , the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country.
Despite income and wealth disparities , the United States continues to rank very high in measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage , median income (both before and after taxes and transfers), human development , per capita GDP , and worker productivity.
The United States is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global military spending , and is a leading political , cultural , and scientific force internationally.
A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection , refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky.
It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc .
Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the sun.
Rainbows can be full circles.
However, the observer normally sees only an arc formed by illuminated droplets above the ground, and centered on a line from the sun to the observer's eye.
In a primary rainbow, the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side.
This rainbow is caused by light being refracted when entering a droplet of water, then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it.
In a double rainbow, a second arc is seen outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colours reversed, with red on the inner side of the arc.
This is caused by the light being reflected twice on the inside of the droplet before leaving it.
In ethics , value denotes the degree of importance of some thing or action, with the aim of determining what actions are best to do or what way is best to live ( normative ethics ), or to describe the significance of different actions.
Value systems are proscriptive and prescriptive beliefs ; they affect ethical behavior of a person or are the basis of their intentional activities.
Often primary values are strong and secondary values are suitable for changes.
What makes an action valuable may in turn depend on the ethical values of the objects it increases, decreases or alters.
An object with ethic value may be termed an ethic or philosophic good ( noun sense).
Values can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of actions or outcomes.
As such, values reflect a person's sense of right and wrong or what ought to be.
Equal rights for all, Excellence deserves admiration, and People should be treated with respect and dignity are representatives of values.
Values tend to influence attitudes and behavior and these types include ethical / moral values, doctrinal / ideological (religious, political) values, social values, and aesthetic values.
It is debated whether some values that are not clearly physiologically determined, such as altruism , are intrinsic , and whether some, such as acquisitiveness, should be classified as vices or virtues .
A judge is a person who presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges .
The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions .
The judge is supposed to conduct the trial impartially and, typically, in an open court .
The judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers or solicitors of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and his or her own personal judgment.
In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury .
In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation , a judge might also be an examining magistrate .
Technique or Techniques may refer to:
In physics , a fluid is a substance that continually deforms (flows) under an applied shear stress , or external force.
Fluids are a phase of matter and include liquids , gases and plasmas .
They are substances with zero shear modulus , or, in simpler terms, substances which cannot resist any shear force applied to them.
Although the term fluid includes both the liquid and gas phases, in common usage, fluid is often used as a synonym for liquid, with no implication that gas could also be present.
This colloquial usage of the term is also common in medicine and in nutrition (take plenty of fluids).
Liquids form a free surface (that is, a surface not created by the container) while gases do not.
Viscoelastic fluids like Silly Putty appear to behave similar to a solid when a sudden force is applied.
Also substances with a very high viscosity such as pitch appear to behave like a solid (see pitch drop experiment ).
A need is something that is necessary for an organism to live a healthy life .
Needs are distinguished from wants in that, in the case of a need, a deficiency causes a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death.
In other words, a need is something required for a safe, stable and healthy life (e.g. air , water , food , land , shelter ) while a want is a desire, wish or aspiration.
When needs or wants are backed by purchasing power , they have the potential to become economic demands .
Basic needs such as air, water, food and protection from environmental dangers are necessary for an organism to live.
In addition to basic needs, humans also have needs of a social or societal nature such as the human need to socialise or belong to a family unit or group.
Needs can be objective and physical , such as the need for food, or psychological and subjective , such as the need for self-esteem .
Needs and wants are a matter of interest in, and form a common substrate for, the fields of philosophy , biology , psychology , social science , economics , marketing and politics .
A cup is an open-top container used to hold liquids for pouring or drinking ; it also can be used to store solids for pouring (e.g., sugar, flour, grains).
Cups may be made of glass , metal , china , clay , wood , stone , polystyrene , plastic , aluminium or other materials, and are usually fixed with a stem , handles , or other adornments.
Cups are used for quenching thirst across a wide range of cultures and social classes , and different styles of cups may be used for different liquids or in different situations.
Cups of different styles may be used for different types of liquids or other foodstuffs (e.g. teacups and measuring cups), in different situations (e.g. at water stations or in ceremonies and rituals), or for decoration .
Bankruptcy is a legal process through which people or other entities who cannot repay debts to creditors may seek relief from some or all of their debts.
In most jurisdictions, bankruptcy is imposed by a court order , often initiated by the debtor .
Bankruptcy is not the only legal status that an insolvent person may have, and the term bankruptcy is therefore not a synonym for insolvency .
In some countries, such as the United Kingdom , bankruptcy is limited to individuals; other forms of insolvency proceedings (such as liquidation and administration ) are applied to companies.
In the United States , bankruptcy is applied more broadly to formal insolvency proceedings.
In France, the cognate French word banqueroute is used solely for cases of fraudulent bankruptcy, whereas the term faillite (cognate of failure) is used for bankruptcy in accordance with the law.

iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc.
All generations of the iPhone use Apple's iOS mobile operating system software.
The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, and multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases have been released since.
The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard .
The iPhone has Wi-Fi and can connect to cellular networks .
An iPhone can take photos , play music , send and receive email , browse the web , send and receive text messages , record notes, perform mathematical calculations, and receive visual voicemail .
Shooting video also became a standard feature with the iPhone 3GS .
Other functionality, such as video games, reference works, and social networking, can be enabled by downloading mobile apps .
As of January 2017 , Apple's App Store contained more than 2.2 million applications available for the iPhone.
Apple has released twelve generations of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the twelve major releases of the iOS operating system.
The first-generation iPhone was a GSM phone and established design precedents, such as a button placement that has persisted throughout all releases and a screen size maintained for the next four iterations.
The iPhone 3G added 3G network support, and was followed by the iPhone 3GS with improved hardware, the iPhone 4 with a metal chassis, higher display resolution and front-facing camera, and the iPhone 4S with improved hardware and the voice assistant Siri .
The iPhone 5 featured a taller, 4-inch display and Apple's newly introduced Lightning connector .
In 2013, Apple released the iPhone 5S with improved hardware and a fingerprint reader , and the lower-cost iPhone 5C , a version of the 5 with colored plastic casings instead of metal.
They were followed by the larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus , with models featuring 4.7-and-5.5-inch (120 and 140 mm) displays.
The iPhone 6S was introduced the following year, which featured hardware upgrades and support for pressure-sensitive touch inputs , as well as the iPhone SE —which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S.
In 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , which add water resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack found on previous models.
The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were released in 2017, adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera.
The iPhone X was released alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less design, an improved camera and a new facial recognition system, named Face ID , but having no home button, and therefore, no Touch ID .
In September 2018, Apple again released 3 new iPhones, which are the iPhone XS , an upgraded version of the since discontinued iPhone X, iPhone XS Max , a larger variant with the series' biggest display as of 2018 and iPhone XR , a lower end version of the iPhone X.
The first-generation iPhone was described as revolutionary and a game-changer for the mobile phone industry.
Subsequent iterations of the iPhone have also garnered praise.
The iPhone is one of the most widely used smartphones in the world, and its success has been credited with helping Apple become one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies .
As of November 1, 2018, a total of more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold.
A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops ; it is the basic facility in food production.
The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms , vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy , pig and poultry farms , and land used for the production of natural fibres , biofuel and other commodities .
It includes ranches , feedlots , orchards , plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land.
In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms , both of which can operate on land or sea.
Farming originated independently in different parts of the world, as hunter gatherer societies transitioned to food production rather than, food capture.
It may have started about 12,000 years ago with the domestication of livestock in the Fertile Crescent in western Asia, soon to be followed by the cultivation of crops.
Modern units tend to specialise in the crops or livestock best suited to the region, with their finished products being sold for the retail market or for further processing, with farm products being traded around the world.
Modern farms in developed countries are highly mechanized .
In the United States , livestock may be raised on rangeland and finished in feedlots and the mechanization of crop production has brought about a great decrease in the number of agricultural workers needed.
In Europe , traditional family farms are giving way to larger production units.
In Australia , some farms are very large because the land is unable to support a high stocking density of livestock because of climatic conditions.
In less developed countries, small farms are the norm, and the majority of rural residents are subsistence farmers , feeding their families and selling any surplus products in the local market.
Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food .
Humans have hunted and killed animals for meat since prehistoric times.
The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs and cattle.
This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale with the aid of slaughterhouses .
Meat is mainly composed of water, protein , and fat .
It is edible raw, but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways.
Unprocessed meat will spoil or rot within hours or days as a result of infection with and decomposition by bacteria and fungi .
Meat is important in economy and culture, even though its mass production and consumption has been determined to pose risks for human health and the environment.
Many religions have rules about which meat may or may not be eaten.
Vegetarians may abstain from eating meat because of concerns about the ethics of eating meat , environmental effects of meat production or nutritional effects of consumption.
A millionaire is an individual whose net worth or wealth is equal to or exceeds one million units of currency .
It can also be a person who owns one million units of currency in a bank account or savings account .
Depending on the currency, a certain level of prestige is associated with being a millionaire, which makes that amount of wealth a goal for some and almost unattainable for others.
In countries that use the short scale number naming system, a billionaire is someone who has at least a thousand times a million dollars, euros or the currency of the given country.
Many national currencies have, or have had at various times, a low unit value, in many cases due to past inflation .
It is obviously much easier and less significant to be a millionaire in those currencies, thus a millionaire (in the local currency) in Hong Kong or Taiwan, for example, may be merely averagely wealthy, or perhaps less wealthy than average.
A millionaire in Zimbabwe in 2007 could have been extremely poor.
At the end of 2018, there were estimated to be just over 14 million US$ millionaires or high-net-worth individual (HNWIs) in the world.
The United States had the highest number of HNWIs (4,900,000) of any country, while New York City had the most HNWIs (377,000) among cities.
Die , as a verb, refers to death , the cessation of life.
Die may also refer to:
Afternoon is the time of day from noon or lunchtime until evening .
There is no exact definition of the time when afternoon ends and evening starts.
(This is equally true for evening and night.) However afternoon is often taken to start directly after noon (12:00pm).
Afternoon ends and evening starts at 5pm or 6pm or maybe just before sunset.
Afternoon is the time when the Sun is descending from its zenith in the sky to somewhat before its terminus in the westerly horizon .
In human life, it occupies roughly the latter half of the standard working and school day.
In literal terms, it refers to a time specifically after noon.
A parody ( ); also called a spoof , send-up , take-off , lampoon , play on (something) , caricature , or joke , is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an original work —its subject, author, style, or some other target—by means of satiric or ironic imitation .
As the literary theorist Linda Hutcheon puts it, parody ...
is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text.
Another critic, Simon Dentith, defines parody as any cultural practice which provides a relatively polemical allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice.
Parody may be found in art or culture, including literature , music (although parody in music has an earlier, somewhat different meaning than for other art forms), animation , gaming , and film .
The writer and critic John Gross observes in his Oxford Book of Parodies , that parody seems to flourish on territory somewhere between pastiche (a composition in another artist's manner, without satirical intent) and burlesque (which fools around with the material of high literature and adapts it to low ends).
Meanwhile, the Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot distinguishes between the parody and the burlesque, A good parody is a fine amusement, capable of amusing and instructing the most sensible and polished minds; the burlesque is a miserable buffoonery which can only please the populace.
Historically, when a formula grows tired, as in the case of the moralistic melodramas in the 1910s, it retains value only as a parody, as demonstrated by the Buster Keaton shorts that mocked that genre.
Risk is the possibility of losing something of value.
Values (such as physical health , social status , emotional well-being, or financial wealth) can be gained or lost when taking risk resulting from a given action or inaction, foreseen or unforeseen (planned or not planned).
Risk can also be defined as the intentional interaction with uncertainty .
Uncertainty is a potential, unpredictable, and uncontrollable outcome; risk is an aspect of action taken in spite of uncertainty.
Risk perception is the subjective judgment people make about the severity and probability of a risk, and may vary person to person.
Any human endeavour carries some risk, but some are much riskier than others.
Dollar (often represented by the dollar sign $ ) is the name of more than 20 currencies , including those of Australia , Canada , Hong Kong , Jamaica , Liberia , Namibia , New Zealand , Singapore , Taiwan , and the United States .
The U.S. dollar is also the official currency of the Caribbean Netherlands , East Timor , Ecuador , El Salvador , the Federated States of Micronesia , the Marshall Islands , Palau , and Zimbabwe .
One dollar is generally divided into 100 cents .
A home , or domicile , is a living space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for an individual, family , household or several families in a tribe .
It is often a house , apartment , or other building , or alternatively a mobile home , houseboat , yurt or any other portable shelter.
A principle of constitutional law in many countries, related to the right to privacy enshrined in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the inviolability of the home as an individual's place of shelter and refuge .
Homes typically provide areas and facilities for sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene.
Larger groups may live in a nursing home , children's home , convent or any similar institution.
A homestead also includes agricultural land and facilities for domesticated animals .
Where more secure dwellings are not available, people may live in the informal and sometimes illegal shacks found in slums and shanty towns .
More generally, home may be considered to be a geographic area, such as a town , village , suburb , city , or country .
The coast , also known as the coastline or seashore , is the area where land meets the sea or ocean , or a line that forms the boundary between the land and the ocean or a lake .
A precise line that can be called a coastline cannot be determined due to the coastline paradox .
The term coastal zone is a region where interaction of the sea and land processes occurs.
Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region (e.g., New Zealand's West Coast , or the East and West Coasts of the United States ).
Edinburgh is an example city on the coast of Great Britain.
The term pelagic coast refers to a coast that fronts the open ocean, as opposed to a more sheltered coast in a gulf or bay .
A shore , on the other hand, can refer to parts of land adjoining any large body of water , including oceans (seashore) and lakes (lake shore).
Similarly, the somewhat related term stream bed or stream bank refers to the land alongside or sloping down to a river (riverbank) or body of water smaller than a lake.
Bank is also used in some parts of the world to refer to an artificial ridge of earth intended to retain the water of a river or pond ; in other places this may be called a levee .
While many scientific experts might agree on a common definition of the term coast , the delineation of the extents of a coast differ according to jurisdiction , with many scientific and government authorities in various countries differing for economic and social policy reasons.
According to the UN atlas, 44% of people live within 150 km (93 mi) of the sea.
An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water .
Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets , skerries , cays or keys.
An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait , and a small island off the coast may be called a holm .
A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago , such as the Philippines .
An island may be described as such, despite the presence of an artificial land bridge; examples are Singapore and its causeway , and the various Dutch delta islands, such as IJsselmonde .
Some places may even retain island in their names for historical reasons after being connected to a larger landmass by a land bridge or landfill, such as Coney Island and Coronado Island , though these are, strictly speaking, tied islands .
Conversely, when a piece of land is separated from the mainland by a man-made canal, for example the Peloponnese by the Corinth Canal or Marble Hill in northern Manhattan during the time between the building of the United States Ship Canal and the filling-in of the Harlem River which surrounded the area, it is generally not considered an island.
There are two main types of islands in the sea: continental and oceanic.
There are also artificial islands .
Eyes are organs of the visual system .
They provide animals with vision , the ability to receive and process visual detail, as well as enabling several photo response functions that are independent of vision.
Eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons .
In higher organisms, the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm , focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals, and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain.
Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system.
Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs , chordates and arthropods .
The simplest eyes, such as those in microorganisms , do nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark , which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms .
From more complex eyes, retinal photosensitive ganglion cells send signals along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to effect circadian adjustment and to the pretectal area to control the pupillary light reflex .
A decade is a period of 10 years .
The word is derived (via French and Latin) from the Ancient Greek : δεκάς , romanized : dekas , which means a group of ten .
Other words for spans of years also come from Latin: biennium (2 years), triennium (3 years), quadrennium (4 years), lustrum (5 years), century (100 years), millennium (1000 years).
A robot is a machine —especially one programmable by a computer — capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.
Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within.
Robots may be constructed on the lines of human form, but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to their aesthetics.
Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda 's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility ( ASIMO ) and TOSY 's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot ( TOPIO ) to industrial robots , medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots , UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator , and even microscopic nano robots .
By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.
Autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade, with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers.
The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics .
These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes , or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition.
Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics .
These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics .
From the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user-configurable automated devices and even automata resembling animals and humans, designed primarily as entertainment.
As mechanical techniques developed through the Industrial age , there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines, remote-control and wireless remote-control .
The term comes from a Czech word, robota , meaning forced labor; the word 'robot' was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 play R.U.R. (Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti - Rossum's Universal Robots) by the Czech writer, Karel Čapek but it was Karel's brother Josef Čapek who was the word's true inventor.
Electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by William Grey Walter in Bristol , England in 1948, as well as Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools in the late 1940s by John T.
Parsons and Frank L.
The first commercial, digital and programmable robot was built by George Devol in 1954 and was named the Unimate .
It was sold to General Motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New Jersey .
Robots have replaced humans in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable to do because of size limitations, or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea.
There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society.
Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions.
The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns.
The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future.
Concrete , usually Portland cement concrete (for its visual resemblance to Portland stone ), is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens over time—most frequently in the past a lime -based cement binder, such as lime putty, but sometimes with other hydraulic cements , such as a calcium aluminate cement or Portland Cement.
It is distinguished from other, non-cementitious types of concrete all binding some form of aggregate together, including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder, which is frequently used for road surfaces , and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder.
When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and water, the mixture forms a fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape.
The cement reacts with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses.
Often, additives (such as pozzolans or superplasticizers ) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material.
Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials (such as rebar ) embedded to provide tensile strength , yielding reinforced concrete .
Concrete is one of the most frequently used building materials.
Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.
Globally, the ready-mix concrete industry, the largest segment of the concrete market, is projected to exceed $600 billion in revenue by 2025.
A bed is a piece of furniture which is used as a place to sleep or relax .
Most modern beds consist of a soft, cushioned mattress on a bed frame , the mattress resting either on a solid base , often wood slats, or a sprung base.
Many beds include a box spring inner-sprung base , which is a large mattress-sized box containing wood and springs that provide additional support and suspension for the mattress.
Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized bassinets and cribs , to small beds for a single person or adult, to large queen and king-size beds designed for two people.
While most beds are single mattresses on a fixed frame, there are other varieties, such as the murphy bed , which folds into a wall, the sofa bed , which folds out of a sofa, and the bunk bed , which provides two mattresses on two tiers.
Temporary beds include the inflatable air mattress and the folding camp cot .
Some beds contain neither a padded mattress nor a bed frame, such as the hammock .
Some beds are made especially for animals .
Beds may have a headboard for resting against, and may have side rails and footboards (or footers).
Headboard only beds may incorporate a dust ruffle, bed skirt, or valance sheet to hide the bed frame.
To support the head, a pillow made of a soft, padded material is usually placed on the top of the mattress.
Some form of covering blanket is often used to insulate the sleeper, often bed sheets , a quilt , or a duvet , collectively referred to as bedding .
Bedding is the removable non-furniture portion of a bed, which enables these components to be washed or aired out.
Ukraine ( Ukrainian : Україна , romanized : Ukrayina ; Ukrainian pronunciation: ukrɑˈjinɑ ), sometimes called the Ukraine , is a country in Eastern Europe .
Excluding Crimea , Ukraine has a population of about 42.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world.
Its capital and largest city is Kiev .
Ukrainian is the official language and its alphabet is Cyrillic .
The dominant religions in the country are Eastern Orthodoxy and Greek Catholicism .
Ukraine is currently in a territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula , which Russia annexed in 2014 .
Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of 603,628 km (233,062 sq mi), making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world.
The territory of modern Ukraine has been inhabited since 32,000 BC.
During the Middle Ages , the area was a key centre of East Slavic culture, with the powerful state of Kievan Rus' forming the basis of Ukrainian identity.
Following its fragmentation in the 13th century, the territory was contested, ruled and divided by a variety of powers, including Lithuania , Poland , Austria-Hungary , the Ottoman Empire and Russia .
A Cossack republic emerged and prospered during the 17th and 18th centuries, but its territory was eventually split between Poland and the Russian Empire , and finally merged fully into the Russian-dominated Soviet Union in the late 1940s as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic .
In 1991, Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union in the aftermath of its dissolution at the end of the Cold War .
Before its independence, Ukraine was typically referred to in English as The Ukraine, but most sources have since moved to drop the from the name of Ukraine in all uses.
Following its independence, Ukraine declared itself a neutral state ; it formed a limited military partnership with Russia and other CIS countries while also establishing a partnership with NATO in 1994.
In 2013, after the government of President Viktor Yanukovych had decided to suspend the Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement and seek closer economic ties with Russia, a several-months-long wave of demonstrations and protests known as the Euromaidan began, which later escalated into the 2014 Ukrainian revolution that led to the overthrow of Yanukovych and the establishment of a new government.
These events formed the background for the annexation of Crimea by Russia in March 2014, and the War in Donbass in April 2014.
On 1 January 2016, Ukraine applied the economic component of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the European Union.
Ukraine is a developing country and ranks 88th on the Human Development Index .
As of 2018, Ukraine has the second lowest GDP per capita in Europe.
At US$ 40, it has the lowest median wealth per adult in the world (real estate not counted, but many Ukrainians possess real estate).
It also suffers from a very high poverty rate and severe corruption .
However, because of its extensive fertile farmlands, Ukraine is one of the world's largest grain exporters .
Ukraine also maintains the second-largest military in Europe after that of Russia.
The country is home to a multi-ethnic population, 77.8 percent of whom are Ukrainians , followed by a very large Russian minority , as well as Georgians , Romanians , Belarusians , Crimean Tatars , Jews , Bulgarians and Hungarians .
Ukraine is a unitary republic under a semi-presidential system with separate powers : legislative , executive and judicial branches .
The country is a member of the United Nations , the Council of Europe , the OSCE , the GUAM organization , and one of the founding states of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
A holiday is a day set aside by custom or by law on which normal activities, especially business or work including school, are suspended or reduced.
Generally, holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or tradition of cultural or religious significance.
Holidays may be designated by governments, religious institutions, or other groups or organizations.
The degree to which normal activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job held or personal choices.
The concept of holidays often originated in connection with religious observances.
The intention of a holiday was typically to allow individuals to tend to religious duties associated with important dates on the calendar.
In most modern societies, however, holidays serve as much of a recreational function as any other weekend days or activities.
In many societies there are important distinctions between holidays designated by governments and holidays designated by religious institutions.
For example, in many predominantly Christian nations, government-designed holidays may center on Christian holidays, though non-Christians may instead observe religious holidays associated with their faith.
In some cases, a holiday may only be nominally observed.
For example, many Jews in the Americas and Europe treat the relatively minor Jewish holiday of Hanukkah as a working holiday, changing very little of their daily routines for this day.
The word holiday has differing connotations in different regions.
In the United States the word is used exclusively to refer to the nationally, religiously or culturally observed day(s) of rest or celebration, or the events themselves, whereas in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth nations , the word may refer to the period of time where leave from ones duties has been agreed, and is used as a synonym to the US preferred vacation .
This time is usually set aside for rest, travel or the participation in recreational activities, with entire industries targeted to coincide or enhance these experiences.
The days of leave may not coincide with any specific customs or laws.
Employers and educational institutes may designate holidays themselves which may or may not overlap nationally or culturally relevant dates, which again comes under this connotation, but it is the first implication detailed that this article is concerned with.
Character(s) may refer to:
Punishment is the imposition of an undesirable or unpleasant outcome upon a group or individual, meted out by an authority —in contexts ranging from child discipline to criminal law —as a response and deterrent to a particular action or behaviour that is deemed undesirable or unacceptable.
The reasoning may be to condition a child to avoid self-endangerment, to impose social conformity (in particular, in the contexts of compulsory education or military discipline ), to defend norms , to protect against future harms (in particular, those from violent crime ), and to maintain the law —and respect for rule of law —under which the social group is governed.
Punishment may be self-inflicted as with self-flagellation and mortification of the flesh in the religious setting, but is most often a form of social coercion .
The unpleasant imposition may include a fine , penalty , or confinement , or be the removal or denial of something pleasant or desirable.
The individual may be a person, or even an animal.
The authority may be either a group or a single person, and punishment may be carried out formally under a system of law or informally in other kinds of social settings such as within a family.
Negative consequences that are not authorized or that are administered without a breach of rules are not considered to be punishment as defined here.
The study and practice of the punishment of crimes , particularly as it applies to imprisonment, is called penology , or, often in modern texts, corrections ; in this context, the punishment process is euphemistically called correctional process.
Research into punishment often includes similar research into prevention.
Justifications for punishment include retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , and incapacitation .
The last could include such measures as isolation, in order to prevent the wrongdoer's having contact with potential victims, or the removal of a hand in order to make theft more difficult.
Of the four justifications, only retribution is part of the definition of punishment and none of the other justifications is a guaranteed outcome, aside from obvious exceptions such as an executed man being incapacitated with regard to further crimes.
If only some of the conditions included in the definition of punishment are present, descriptions other than punishment may be considered more accurate.
Inflicting something negative, or unpleasant, on a person or animal, without authority is considered revenge or spite rather than punishment.
In addition, the word punishment is used as a metaphor, as when a boxer experiences punishment during a fight.
In other situations, breaking a rule may be rewarded, and so receiving such a reward naturally does not constitute punishment.
Finally the condition of breaking (or breaching) the rules must be satisfied for consequences to be considered punishment.
Punishments differ in their degree of severity, and may include sanctions such as reprimands , deprivations of privileges or liberty , fines, incarcerations , ostracism , the infliction of pain , amputation and the death penalty .
Corporal punishment refers to punishments in which physical pain is intended to be inflicted upon the transgressor.Punishments may be judged as fair or unfair in terms of their degree of reciprocity and proportionality to the offense.Punishment can be an integral part of socialization, and punishing unwanted behaviour is often part of a system of pedagogy or behavioral modification which also includes rewards.
Reconciliation may refer to:
A display device is an output device for presentation of information in visual or tactile form (the latter used for example in tactile electronic displays for blind people).
When the input information that is supplied has an electrical signal the display is called an electronic display .
Common applications for electronic visual displays are television sets or computer monitors .

In mathematics , a combination is a selection of items from a collection, such that (unlike permutations ) the order of selection does not matter.
For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange.More formally, a k - combination of a set S is a subset of k distinct elements of S .
If the set has n elements, the number of k -combinations is equal to the binomial coefficient
which can be written using factorials as n ! k ! ( n − k ) ! {\\displaystyle \extstyle {\\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}}} whenever k ≤ n {\\displaystyle k\\leq n} , and which is zero when k > n {\\displaystyle k>n} .
The set of all k -combinations of a set S is often denoted by ( S k ) {\\displaystyle \extstyle {\\binom {S}{k}}} .
Combinations refer to the combination of n things taken k at a time without repetition.
To refer to combinations in which repetition is allowed, the terms k -selection, k - multiset , or k -combination with repetition are often used.
If, in the above example, it were possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more 2-selections: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears.
Although the set of three fruits was small enough to write a complete list of combinations, with large sets this becomes impractical.
For example, a poker hand can be described as a 5-combination ( k = 5) of cards from a 52 card deck ( n = 52).
The 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand does not matter.
There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of drawing any one hand at random is 1 / 2,598,960.
In the context of human society , a family (from Latin : familia ) is a group of people related either by consanguinity (by recognized birth), affinity (by marriage or other relationship), or co-residence (as implied by the etymology of the English word family) or some combination of these.
Members of the immediate family may include spouses, parents, brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters.
Members of the extended family may include grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, and siblings-in-law .
Sometimes these are also considered members of the immediate family, depending on an individual's specific relationship with them.
In most societies, the family is the principal institution for the socialization of children.
As the basic unit for raising children, loving them, and caring for them anthropologists generally classify most family organizations as matrifocal (a mother and her children); conjugal (a wife, her husband, and children, also called the nuclear family ); avuncular (for example, a grandparent, a brother, his sister, and her children); or extended (parents and children co-reside with other members of one parent's family).
Sexual relations among the members are regulated by rules concerning incest such as the incest taboo .
The word family can be used metaphorically to create more inclusive categories such as community , nationhood , global village , and humanism .
The field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history.
The family is also an important economic unit studied in family economics .
One of the primary functions of the family involves providing a framework for the production and reproduction of persons biologically and socially.
This can occur through the sharing of material substances (such as food); the giving and receiving of care and nurture ( nurture kinship ); jural rights and obligations; and moral and sentimental ties.
Thus, one's experience of one's family shifts over time.
From the perspective of children , the family is a family of orientation: the family serves to locate children socially and plays a major role in their enculturation and socialization.
From the point of view of the parent(s), the family is a family of procreation, the goal of which is to produce and enculturate and socialize children.
However, producing children is not the only function of the family; in societies with a sexual division of labor, marriage , and the resulting relationship between two people, it is necessary for the formation of an economically productive household .
Christopher Harris notes that the western conception of family is ambiguous and confused with the household , as revealed in the different contexts in which the word is used.
Olivia Harris states this confusion is not accidental, but indicative of the familial ideology of capitalist , western countries that pass social legislation that insists members of a nuclear family should live together, and that those not so related should not live together; despite the ideological and legal pressures, a large percentage of families do not conform to the ideal nuclear family type.
The total fertility rate of women varies from country to country, from a high of 6.76 children born/woman in Niger to a low of 0.81 in Singapore (as of 2015).
Fertility is low in most Eastern European and Southern European countries; and high in most Sub-Saharan African countries.
In some cultures, the mother's preference of family size influences that of the children through early adulthood.
A parent's number of children strongly correlates with the number of children that they will eventually have.
Credit (from Latin credit , (he/she/it) believes) is the trust which allows one party to provide money or resources to another party wherein the second party does not reimburse the first party immediately (thereby generating a debt ), but promises either to repay or return those resources (or other materials of equal value) at a later date.
In other words, credit is a method of making reciprocity formal, legally enforceable, and extensible to a large group of unrelated people.
The resources provided may be financial (e.g. granting a loan ), or they may consist of goods or services (e.g. consumer credit).
Credit encompasses any form of deferred payment.
Credit is extended by a creditor , also known as a lender , to a debtor , also known as a borrower .
Gambling is the wagering of money or something of value (referred to as the stakes) on an event with an uncertain outcome, with the primary intent of winning money or material goods.
Gambling thus requires three elements to be present: consideration (an amount wagered), risk (chance), and a prize .
The outcome of the wager is often immediate, such as a single roll of dice , a spin of a roulette wheel, or a horse crossing the finish line, but longer time frames are also common, allowing wagers on the outcome of a future sports contest or even an entire sports season.
The term gaming in this context typically refers to instances in which the activity has been specifically permitted by law .
The two words are not mutually exclusive; i.e. , a gaming company offers (legal) gambling activities to the public and may be regulated by one of many gaming control boards , for example, the Nevada Gaming Control Board .
However, this distinction is not universally observed in the English-speaking world.
For instance, in the United Kingdom, the regulator of gambling activities is called the Gambling Commission (not the Gaming Commission).
The word gaming is used more frequently since the rise of computer and video games to describe activities that do not necessarily involve wagering, especially online gaming , with the new usage still not having displaced the old usage as the primary definition in common dictionaries.
Gaming has also been used to circumvent laws against gambling.
Gambling is also a major international commercial activity, with the legal gambling market totaling an estimated $335 billion in 2009.
In other forms, gambling can be conducted with materials which have a value, but are not real money.
For example, players of marbles games might wager marbles, and likewise games of Pogs or Magic: The Gathering can be played with the collectible game pieces (respectively, small discs and trading cards) as stakes, resulting in a meta-game regarding the value of a player's collection of pieces.
A garret is a habitable attic or small and often dismal or cramped living space at the top of a house or larger residential building.
In the days before lifts ( elevators ) this was the least prestigious position in a building.
In this era, the garret often had sloping ceilings.
An era is a span of time defined for the purposes of chronology or historiography , as in the regnal eras in the history of a given monarchy, a calendar era used for a given calendar , or the geological eras defined for the history of Earth .
Comparable terms are epoch , age , period , saeculum , aeon (Greek aion ) and Sanskrit yuga .
Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix .
Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , and decreased appetite .
However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms.
Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis .
Appendicitis is caused by a blockage of the hollow portion of the appendix.
This is most commonly due to a calcified stone made of feces .
Inflamed lymphoid tissue from a viral infection, parasites , gallstone , or tumors may also cause the blockage.
This blockage leads to increased pressures in the appendix, decreased blood flow to the tissues of the appendix, and bacterial growth inside the appendix causing inflammation.
The combination of inflammation, reduced blood flow to the appendix and distention of the appendix causes tissue injury and tissue death.
If this process is left untreated, the appendix may burst, releasing bacteria into the abdominal cavity, leading to increased complications.
The diagnosis of appendicitis is largely based on the person's signs and symptoms.
In cases where the diagnosis is unclear, close observation, medical imaging , and laboratory tests can be helpful.
The two most common imaging tests used are an ultrasound and computed tomography (CT scan).
CT scan has been shown to be more accurate than ultrasound in detecting acute appendicitis.
However, ultrasound may be preferred as the first imaging test in children and pregnant women because of the risks associated with radiation exposure from CT scans.
The standard treatment for acute appendicitis is surgical removal of the appendix .
This may be done by an open incision in the abdomen ( laparotomy ) or through a few smaller incisions with the help of cameras ( laparoscopy ).
Surgery decreases the risk of side effects or death associated with rupture of the appendix.
Antibiotics may be equally effective in certain cases of non-ruptured appendicitis.
It is one of the most common and significant causes of severe abdominal pain that comes on quickly .
In 2015 about 11.6 million cases of appendicitis occurred which resulted in about 50,100 deaths.
In the United States, appendicitis is the most common cause of sudden abdominal pain requiring surgery.
Each year in the United States, more than 300,000 people with appendicitis have their appendix surgically removed.
Reginald Fitz is credited with being the first person to describe the condition in 1886.
Animation is a method in which pictures are manipulated to appear as moving images.
In traditional animation , images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film .
Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI).
Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation , while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings.
Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts , puppets or clay figures .
Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other.
The illusion—as in motion pictures in general—is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement , but the exact causes are still uncertain.
Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope , zoetrope , flip book , praxinoscope and film.
Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally .
For display on the computer, techniques like animated GIF and Flash animation were developed.
Animation is more pervasive than many people realise.
Apart from short films , feature films , animated gifs and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also heavily used for video games , motion graphics and special effects .
Animation is also prevalent in information technology interfaces.
The physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics – in for instance the moving images in magic lantern shows – can also be considered animation.
The mechanical manipulation of puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in automata .
Automata were popularised by Disney as animatronics .
Animators are artists who specialize in creating animation.
A fact is a thing that is known to be consistent with objective reality and can be proven to be true with evidence .
For example, this sentence contains words is a linguistic fact, and the sun is a star is a cosmological fact.
Further, Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States and Abraham Lincoln was assassinated are also both facts, of the historical type.
All of these statements have the epistemic quality of being ontologically superior to opinion or interpretation — they are either categorically necessary or supported by adequate historical documentation.
Conversely, while it may be both consistent and true that most cats are cute, it is not a fact (although in cases of opinion there is an argument for the acceptance of popular opinion as a statement of common wisdom , particularly if ascertained by scientific polling ).
Generally speaking, facts transcend belief and serve as concrete descriptions of a state of affairs on which beliefs can later be assigned.
The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability — that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience .
Standard reference works are often used to check facts.
Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means.
Web usually refers to:
Web or WEB may also refer to:
A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with commonality such as norms , religion , values , customs , or identity .
Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighbourhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms.
Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at large.
Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, community may also refer to large group affiliations such as national communities , international communities , and virtual communities .
The English-language word community derives from the Old French comuneté , which comes from the Latin communitas community, public spirit (from Latin communis , shared in common).
Human communities may share intent , belief , resources , preferences , needs , and risks in common, affecting the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.
In biology , an organism (from Greek : ὀργανισμός, organismos ) is any individual entity that propagates the properties of life .
It is a synonym for life form .
Organisms are classified by taxonomy into specified groups such as the multicellular animals , plants , and fungi ; or unicellular microorganisms such as a protists , bacteria , and archaea .
All types of organisms are capable of reproduction , growth and development , maintenance , and some degree of response to stimuli .
Humans are multicellular animals composed of many trillions of cells which differentiate during development into specialized tissues and organs .
An organism may be either a prokaryote or a eukaryote .
Prokaryotes are represented by two separate domains – bacteria and archaea .
Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called organelles (such as mitochondria in animals and plants and plastids in plants and algae , all generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria).
Fungi, animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms within the eukaryotes.
Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which only about 1.2 million have been documented.
More than 99% of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived are estimated to be extinct .
In 2016, a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms was identified.
Dots may refer to:
DOTS may be an acronym for:
Storytelling describes the social and cultural activity of sharing stories , sometimes with improvisation , theatrics , or embellishment.
Every culture has its own stories or narratives , which are shared as a means of entertainment , education, cultural preservation or instilling moral values.
Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot , characters and narrative point of view .
The term storytelling can refer in a narrow sense specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.
An oil is any nonpolar chemical substance that is a viscous liquid at ambient temperatures and is both hydrophobic (does not mix with water , literally water fearing) and lipophilic (mixes with other oils, literally fat loving).
Oils have a high carbon and hydrogen content and are usually flammable and surface active .
The general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds that may be otherwise unrelated in structure, properties, and uses.
Oils may be animal , vegetable , or petrochemical in origin, and may be volatile or non-volatile.
They are used for food (e.g., olive oil ), fuel (e.g., heating oil ), medical purposes (e.g., mineral oil ), lubrication (e.g. motor oil ), and the manufacture of many types of paints, plastics, and other materials.
Specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies and rituals as purifying agents.
The mile is an English unit of length of linear measure equal to 5,280 feet, or 1,760 yards, and standardised as exactly 1,609.344 metres by international agreement in 1959.
With qualifiers , mile is also used to describe or translate a wide range of units derived from or roughly equivalent to the Roman mile , such as the nautical mile (now 1.852 km exactly), the Italian mile (roughly 1.852 km), and the Chinese mile (now 500 m exactly).
The Romans divided their mile into 5,000 roman feet but the greater importance of furlongs in pre-modern England meant that the statute mile was made equivalent to 8 furlongs or 5,280 feet in 1593.
This form of the mile then spread to the British-colonized nations some of which continue to employ the mile.
The US Geological Survey now employs the metre for official purposes but legacy data from its 1927 geodetic datum has meant that a separate US survey mile ( 6336 / 3937 km) continues to see some use.
While most countries replaced the mile with the kilometre when switching to the International System of Units , the international mile continues to be used in some countries, such as Liberia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and a number of countries with fewer than one million inhabitants, most of which are UK or US territories, or have close historical ties with the UK or US.
The mile was usually abbreviated m.
in the past but is now sometimes written as mi to avoid confusion with the SI metre .
However, derived units, such as miles per hour or miles per gallon , continue to be universally abbreviated as mph and mpg , respectively.
Confucianism , also known as Ruism , is described as tradition, a philosophy, a religion, a humanistic or rationalistic religion, a way of governing, or simply a way of life.
Confucianism developed from what was later called the Hundred Schools of Thought from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551–479 BCE), who considered himself a recodifier and retransmitter of the theology and values inherited from the Shang (c.
1600–1046 BCE) and Zhou dynasties (c.
1046–256 BCE).
In the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), Confucian approaches edged out the proto-Taoist Huang–Lao as the official ideology, while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism .
A Confucian revival began during the Tang dynasty (618–907).
In the late Tang, Confucianism developed in response to Buddhism and Taoism and was reformulated as Neo-Confucianism .
This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the imperial exams and the core philosophy of the scholar official class in the Song dynasty (960–1297).
The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism.
The intellectuals of the New Culture Movement of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China's weaknesses.
They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings; some of these new ideologies include the Three Principles of the People with the establishment of the Republic of China , and then Maoism under the People's Republic of China .
In the late twentieth century Confucian work ethic has been credited with the rise of the East Asian economy .
With particular emphasis on the importance of the family and social harmony, rather than on an otherworldly source of spiritual values, the core of Confucianism is humanistic .
According to Herbert Fingarette 's conceptualisation of Confucianism as a religion which regards the secular as sacred , Confucianism transcends the dichotomy between religion and humanism, considering the ordinary activities of human life—and especially human relationships—as a manifestation of the sacred, because they are the expression of humanity's moral nature ( xìng 性), which has a transcendent anchorage in Heaven ( Tiān 天) and unfolds through an appropriate respect for the spirits or gods ( shén ) of the world.
While Tiān has some characteristics that overlap the category of godhead, it is primarily an impersonal absolute principle , like the Dào (道) or the Brahman .
Confucianism focuses on the practical order that is given by a this-worldly awareness of the Tiān .
Confucian liturgy (called 儒 rú , or sometimes 正統/正统 zhèngtǒng , meaning ' orthoprax ') led by Confucian priests or sages of rites (禮生/礼生 lǐshēng ) to worship the gods in public and ancestral Chinese temples is preferred on certain occasions, by Confucian religious groups and for civil religious rites, over Taoist or popular ritual.
The worldly concern of Confucianism rests upon the belief that human beings are fundamentally good, and teachable, improvable, and perfectible through personal and communal endeavor, especially self-cultivation and self-creation.
Confucian thought focuses on the cultivation of virtue in a morally organised world.
Some of the basic Confucian ethical concepts and practices include rén , yì , and lǐ , and zhì .
Rén (仁, 'benevolence' or 'humaneness') is the essence of the human being which manifests as compassion.
It is the virtue-form of Heaven.
Yì (義/义) is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good.
Lǐ (禮/礼) is a system of ritual norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act in everyday life in harmony with the law of Heaven.
Zhì (智) is the ability to see what is right and fair, or the converse, in the behaviors exhibited by others.
Confucianism holds one in contempt, either passively or actively, for failure to uphold the cardinal moral values of rén and yì .
Traditionally, cultures and countries in the Chinese cultural sphere are strongly influenced by Confucianism, including mainland China , Taiwan , Hong Kong , Macau , Korea , Japan , and Vietnam , as well as various territories settled predominantly by Chinese people , such as Singapore .
Today, it has been credited for shaping East Asian societies and Chinese communities , and to some extent, other parts of Asia .
In the last decades there have been talks of a Confucian Revival in the academic and the scholarly community, and there has been a grassroots proliferation of various types of Confucian churches .
In late 2015 many Confucian personalities formally established a national Holy Confucian Church (孔聖會/孔圣会 Kǒngshènghuì ) in China to unify the many Confucian congregations and civil society organisations.
A finger is a limb of the human body and a type of digit , an organ of manipulation and sensation found in the hands of humans and other primates .
Normally humans have five digits, the bones of which are termed phalanges, on each hand, although some people have more or fewer than five due to congenital disorders such as polydactyly or oligodactyly , or accidental or medical amputations .
The first digit is the thumb , followed by index finger , middle finger , ring finger , and little finger or pinkie.
According to different definitions, the thumb can be called a finger, or not.
News is information about current events.
This may be provided through many different media : word of mouth , printing , postal systems , broadcasting , electronic communication , or through the testimony of observers and witnesses to events.
Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events.
Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times.
Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information.
Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content.
The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the newspaper , which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with paper and printing press , to Europe.
Death is the permanent cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism .
Phenomena which commonly bring about death include aging , predation , malnutrition , disease , suicide , homicide , starvation , dehydration , and accidents or major trauma resulting in terminal injury .
In most cases, bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death.
Death – particularly the death of humans – has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion, due to the affection for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial bonds with the deceased.
Other concerns include fear of death , necrophobia , anxiety , sorrow , grief , emotional pain , depression , sympathy , compassion , solitude , or saudade .
Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife , and also hold the idea of reward or judgement and punishment for past sin .
Golden means made of, or relating to gold .
Golden may also refer to:

Iran , also called Persia , and officially the Islamic Republic of Iran , is a country in Western Asia .
With 82 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 18th most populous country .
Its territory spans 1,648,195 km (636,372 sq mi), making it the second largest country in the Middle East and the 17th largest in the world .
Iran is bordered to the northwest by Armenia and the Republic of Azerbaijan , to the north by the Caspian Sea , to the northeast by Turkmenistan , to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan , to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman , and to the west by Turkey and Iraq .
Its central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz , give it geostrategic importance.
Tehran is the political and economic center of Iran, and the largest and most populous city in Western Asia with more than 8.8 million residents in the city and 15 million in the larger metropolitan area.
Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations , beginning with the formation of the Elamite kingdoms in the fourth millennium BCE.
It was first unified by the Iranian Medes in the seventh century BCE, and reached its territorial height in the sixth century BCE under Cyrus the Great , whose Achaemenid Empire stretched from Eastern Europe to the Indus Valley , one of the largest empires in history.
The empire fell to Alexander the Great in the fourth century BCE and was divided into several Hellenistic states.
An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BCE, which was succeeded in the third century CE by the Sasanian Empire , a leading world power for the next four centuries.
Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century CE, and the subsequent Islamization of Iran led to the decline of the once dominant Zoroastrian religion.
Iran's major contributions to art, philosophy, and science spread throughout the Muslim world and beyond during the Islamic Golden Age .
Over the next two centuries, a series of native Muslim dynasties emerged before the Seljuq Turks and the Ilkhanate Mongols conquered the region.
The rise of the native Safavids in the 15th century led to the reestablishment of a unified Iranian state and national identity, with the country's conversion to Shia Islam marking a turning point in Iranian and Muslim history .
Under Nader Shah , Iran was one of the most powerful states in the 18th century, though by the 19th century, a series of conflicts with the Russian Empire led to significant territorial losses.
The Persian Constitutional Revolution in the early 20th century created a constitutional monarchy and the country's first legislature .
A 1953 coup instigated by the United Kingdom and the United States resulted in greater autocratic rule under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and growing Western political influence.
A far-reaching series of reforms known as the White Revolution was launched by the Shah in 1963, prompting industrial growth, land reforms, and increased women's rights .
Nevertheless, widespread dissatisfaction and unrest against the monarchy persisted, leading to the Iranian Revolution , which established the current Islamic Republic .
For most of the 1980s, Iran fought a war with Iraq that resulted in severe casualties and economic devastation for both sides.
Iran's political system has elements of a presidential democracy with a theocracy governed by an autocratic Supreme Leader .
It has been described as authoritarian , with significant constraints and abuses against human rights .
Iran is a founding member of the UN , ECO , NAM , OIC , and OPEC .
It is a major regional and middle power , and its large reserves of fossil fuels - including the world's largest natural gas supply and the fourth largest proven oil reserves - exert considerable influence in international energy security and the world economy .
The country's rich cultural legacy is reflected in part by its 22 UNESCO World Heritage sites , the third largest number in Asia and 11th largest in the world.
Historically a multi-ethnic country, Iran remains a pluralistic society comprising numerous ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups , the largest being Persians , Azeris , Kurds , Mazandaranis and Lurs .
A meeting is when two or more people come together to discuss one or more topics, often in a formal or business setting, but meetings also occur in a variety of other environments.
Many various types of meetings exist.
A park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats.
Urban parks are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities.
National parks and Country parks are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside.
State parks and Provincial parks are administered by sub-national government states and agencies.
Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments , fountains or playground structures.
Many parks have fields for playing sports such as soccer , baseball and football , and paved areas for games such as basketball .
Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities.
Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area.
Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills.
The largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands square kilometers (or square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers.
In many large parks, camping in tents is allowed with a permit.
Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g. rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles).
Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a park ranger or a park warden .
Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months.
There are also amusement parks which have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance or skill.
The stomach is a muscular, hollow organ in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and many other animals, including several invertebrates .
The stomach has a dilated structure and functions as a vital digestive organ.
In the digestive system the stomach is involved in the second phase of digestion, following chewing .
It performs a chemical breakdown due to enzymes and hydrochloric acid.
In humans and many other animals, the stomach is located between the oesophagus and the small intestine .
It secretes digestive enzymes and gastric acid to aid in food digestion.
The pyloric sphincter controls the passage of partially digested food ( chyme ) from the stomach into the duodenum where peristalsis takes over to move this through the rest of the intestines.
The cat ( Felis catus ) is a small carnivorous mammal .
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family .
The cat is either a house cat or a farm cat , which are pets , or a feral cat , which ranges freely and avoids human contact.
A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents .
About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries .
Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey.
They are predators who are most active at dawn and dusk ( crepuscular ).
Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals.
Compared to humans, they see better in the dark (they see in near total darkness) and have a better sense of smell , but poorer color vision .
Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species .
Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations including meowing , purring , trilling , hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language .
Cats also communicate by secreting and perceiving pheromones .
Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two to five kittens.
Domestic cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats , a hobby known as cat fancy .
Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering , as well as abandonment of pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird species, and evoking population control .
It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in Egypt, because cats in ancient Egypt were venerated from around 3100 BC .
However, the earliest indication for the taming of an African wildcat ( F.
lybica ) was found in Cyprus , where a cat skeleton was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave dating to around 7500 BC.
African wildcats were probably first domesticated in the Near East .
The leopard cat ( Prionailurus bengalensis ) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.
As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the U.S. by number of pets owned, after freshwater fish , with 95 million cats owned.
As of 2017, it was ranked the third-most popular pet in the UK, after fish and dogs , with around 8 million being owned.
The number of cats in the United Kingdom has nearly doubled since 1965, when the cat population was 4.1 million.
Channel , channels , channeling , etc., may refer to:
Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light .
In other words, brightness is the perception elicited by the luminance of a visual target.
It is not necessarily proportional to luminance.
This is a subjective attribute/property of an object being observed and one of the color appearance parameters of color appearance models .
Brightness refers to an absolute term and should not be confused with Lightness .
The adjective bright derives from an Old English beorht with the same meaning via metathesis giving Middle English briht .
The word is from a Common Germanic * berhtaz , ultimately from a PIE root with a closely related meaning, * bhereg- white, bright.Brightness was formerly used as a synonym for the photometric term luminance and (incorrectly) for the radiometric term radiance .
As defined by the US Federal Glossary of Telecommunication Terms ( FS-1037C ), brightness should now be used only for non-quantitative references to physiological sensations and perceptions of light.
A given target luminance can elicit different perceptions of brightness in different contexts; see, for example, White's illusion .
In the RGB color space , brightness can be thought of as the arithmetic mean μ of the red, green, and blue color coordinates (although some of the three components make the light seem brighter than others, which, again, may be compensated by some display systems automatically):
Brightness is also a color coordinate in HSL color space : hue , saturation , and lightness, meaning here brightness.
With regard to stars , brightness is quantified as apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude .
Brightness is, at least in some respects, the antonym of darkness .
The Hunches were a garage rock band from Portland , Oregon active from 2000 to 2009.
They released three studio albums: Yes.
No. Shut It (2002), Hobo Sunrise (2004), and Exit Dreams (2009), all on In the Red Records .
Urban means related to cities .
In that sense, the term may refer to:
Urban may also refer to:
An individual is that which exists as a distinct entity .
Individuality (or self-hood) is the state or quality of being an individual; particularly of being a person separate from other people and possessing their own needs or goals , rights and responsibilities .
The exact definition of an individual is important in the fields of biology , law , and philosophy .
From the 15th century and earlier (and also today within the fields of statistics and metaphysics ) individual meant indivisible , typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning a person.
From the 17th century on, individual indicates separateness, as in individualism .
Although individuality and individualism are commonly considered to mature with age/time and experience/wealth, a sane adult human being is usually considered by the state as an individual person in law, even if the person denies individual culpability (I followed instructions).
An individual person is accountable for their actions/decisions/instructions, subject to prosecution in both national and international law, from the time that they have reached age of majority , often though not always more or less coinciding with the granting of voting rights , tax and military duties / individual right to bear arms (protected only under certain constitutions).
In line with hierarchy , ultimate individual human reward for success and responsibility for failure is nonetheless found at the top of human society
A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit .
Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets .
Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries.
Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities.
In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords .
Banking in its modern sense evolved in the 14th century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world .
In the history of banking , a number of banking dynasties – notably, the Medicis , the Fuggers , the Welsers , the Berenbergs , and the Rothschilds – have played a central role over many centuries.
The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena , while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank .
Staff may refer to:
A hydrant is an outlet from a fluid main often consisting of an upright pipe with a valve attached from which fluid (e.g. water or fuel ) can be tapped.
A system is a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole.
A system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning.
Systems are the subjects of study of systems theory .

An ocean (from Ancient Greek Ὠκεανός , transc.
Okeanós ) is a body of water that composes much of a planet 's hydrosphere .
On Earth , an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean .
These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific , Atlantic , Indian , Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans.
The word ocean is often used interchangeably with sea in American English .
Strictly speaking, a sea is a body of water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land, though the sea refers also to the oceans.
Saline water covers approximately 361,000,000 km (139,000,000 sq mi) and is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71% of Earth's surface and 90% of the Earth's biosphere .
The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water, and oceanographers have stated that less than 5% of the World Ocean has been explored.
The total volume is approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu mi) with an average depth of nearly 3,700 meters (12,100 ft).
As the world ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, it is integral to life , forms part of the carbon cycle , and influences climate and weather patterns.
The World Ocean is the habitat of 230,000 known species , but because much of it is unexplored, the number of species that exist in the ocean is much larger, possibly over two million.
The origin of Earth's oceans is unknown; oceans are thought to have formed in the Hadean eon and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life .
Extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of water or other elements and compounds .
The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of Titan , although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the Solar System .
Early in their geologic histories, Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans.
The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water, and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus.
Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice .
Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites; notably, the ocean of the moon Europa is estimated to have over twice the water volume of Earth.
The Solar System's giant planets are also thought to have liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions.
Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons , including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone .
Ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid.
Pebbles is the plural form of the word pebble .
Pebbles may also refer to:
A prince is a male ruler ranked below a king and above a duke or member of a monarch's or former monarch's family.
Prince is also a title of nobility , often hereditary , in some European states .
The feminine equivalent is a princess .
The English word derives, via the French word prince , from the Latin noun princeps , from primus (first) and capio (to seize), meaning the chief, most distinguished, ruler , prince.
Account may refer to:
Plane or planes may refer to:
A material is a chemical substance or mixture of substances that constitutes an object.
Materials can be pure or impure, living or non-living matter.
Materials can be classified based on their physical and chemical properties , or on their geological origin or biological function.
Materials science is the study of materials and their applications.
Raw materials can be processed in different ways to influence their properties, by purification, shaping or the introduction of other materials.
New materials can be produced from raw materials by synthesis .
In industry , materials are inputs to manufacturing processes to produce products or more complex materials.
Save or Saved may refer to:
A city is a large human settlement .
Cities generally have extensive systems for housing , transportation , sanitation , utilities , land use , and communication .
Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organizations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process.
Historically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization , roughly half of the world population now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability.
Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas —creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centers for employment, entertainment, and edification.
However, in a world of intensifying globalization , all cities are in different degree also connected globally beyond these regions.
The most populated city proper is Chongqing while the most populous metropolitan areas are the Greater Tokyo Area , the Shanghai area, and Jabodetabek ( Jakarta ).
The cities of Faiyum , Damascus , and Varanasi are among those laying claim to longest continual inhabitation .
A season is a division of the year marked by changes in weather , ecology , and amount of daylight .
On Earth , seasons result from Earth's orbit around the Sun and Earth's axial tilt relative to the ecliptic plane.
In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to undergo hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations.
During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun.
The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January.
It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months , which increases the solar flux .
However, due to seasonal lag , June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four seasons based on the Gregorian calendar are generally recognized: spring , summer , autumn or fall , and winter .
The definition of seasons is also cultural.
In India from the ancient times, six seasons or Ritu based on south Asian religious or cultural calendars are recognised and identified even today for the purposes such as agriculture and trade.
Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions which are not tied to any fixed calendar dates: prevernal , vernal , estival , serotinal , autumnal , and hibernal .
Many tropical regions have two seasons: the rainy , wet , or monsoon season and the dry season .
Some have a third cool , mild , or harmattan season .
Seasons often held special significance for agrarian societies, whose lives revolved around planting and harvest times, and the change of seasons was often attended by ritual .
In some parts of the world, some other seasons capture the timing of important ecological events such as hurricane season , tornado season , and wildfire season .
The most historically important of these are the three seasons— flood , growth , and low water —which were previously defined by the former annual flooding of the Nile in Egypt .
Succession is the act or process of following in order or sequence.
Mystery , The Mystery , Mysteries or The Mysteries may refer to:
Story or stories may refer to:
In physics , sound is a vibration that typically propagates as an audible wave of pressure, through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid.
In human physiology and psychology , sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain .
Humans can only hear sound waves as distinct pitches when the frequency lies between about 20 Hz and 20 kHz. Sound waves above 20 kHz are known as ultrasound and is not perceptible by humans.
Sound waves below 20 Hz are known as infrasound .
Different animal species have varying hearing ranges .
Copy may refer to:
Angeles may refer to:
The true finches are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family Fringillidae.
Finches have stout conical bills adapted for eating seeds and often have colourful plumage.
They occupy a great range of habitats where they are usually resident and do not migrate.
They have a worldwide distribution except for Australia and the polar regions.
The family includes species known as siskins, canaries, redpolls, serins, grosbeaks and euphonias.
Many birds in other families are also commonly called finches.
These groups include: the estrildid finches ( Estrildidae ) of the Old World tropics and Australia ; some members of the Old World bunting family ( Emberizidae ) and the American sparrow family ( Passerellidae ); and the Darwin's finches of the Galapagos islands, now considered members of the tanager family ( Thraupidae ).
Finches and canaries were used in the UK, Canada and USA in the coal mining industry, to detect carbon monoxide from the eighteenth to twentieth century.
This practice ceased in the UK in 1986.
The aorta ( ay- OR -tə ) is the main and largest artery in the human body , originating from the left ventricle of the heart and extending down to the abdomen , where it splits into two smaller arteries (the common iliac arteries ).
The aorta distributes oxygenated blood to all parts of the body through the systemic circulation .
Cell may refer to:
A patient is any recipient of health care services.
The patient is most often ill or injured and in need of treatment by a physician , nurse , psychologist , dentist , veterinarian , or other health care provider .
A poet is a person who creates poetry .
Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others.
A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.
The work of a poet is essentially one of communication, either expressing ideas in a literal sense, such as writing about a specific event or place, or metaphorically.
Poets have existed since antiquity, in nearly all languages, and have produced works that vary greatly in different cultures and periods.
Throughout each civilization and language, poets have used various styles that have changed through the course of literary history, resulting in a history of poets as diverse as the literature they have produced.
Development or developing may refer to:
Profit may refer to:
A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype , product or process .
The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design.
In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity.
A design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints , may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment .
Major examples of designs include architectural blueprints , engineering drawings , business processes , circuit diagrams , and sewing patterns .
The person who produces a design is a designer , which is a term generally used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas - usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a textile designer , fashion designer , product designer , concept designer , web designer ( website designer ) or interior designer ), but also others such as architects and engineers.
A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process, possibly using design methods .
The process of creating a design can be brief (a quick sketch) or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research, negotiation, reflection, modelling , interactive adjustment and re-design.
Parking is the act of stopping and disengaging a vehicle and leaving it unoccupied.
Parking on one or both sides of a road is often permitted, though sometimes with restrictions.
Some buildings have parking facilities for use of the buildings' users.
Countries and local governments have rules for design and use of parking spaces .
Walls may refer to:
An industry is the production of goods or related services within an economy .
The major source of revenue of a group or company is the indicator of its relevant industry.
When a large group has multiple sources of revenue generation, it is considered to be working in different industries.
Manufacturing industry became a key sector of production and labour in European and North American countries during the Industrial Revolution , upsetting previous mercantile and feudal economies.
This came through many successive rapid advances in technology, such as the production of steel and coal .
Following the Industrial Revolution, possibly a third of the economic output comes from manufacturing industries.
Many developed countries and many developing/semi-developed countries (China, India etc.) depend significantly on manufacturing industry.
A consumer is a person or organization that uses or consumes economic services or commodities .
II is the Roman numeral for 2.
II may also refer to:
The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals.
The brain is located in the head , usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision .
The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body.
In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14–16 billion neurons , and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion.
Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons.
These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons , which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.
Physiologically , the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body.
The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones .
This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment .
Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia , but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.
The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved.
Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways.
This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates.
It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains.
The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article.
Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context.
The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage, that are covered in the human brain article.
Sales are activities related to selling or the number of goods or services sold in a given time period.
The seller, or the provider of the goods or services , completes a sale in response to an acquisition , appropriation , requisition , or a direct interaction with the buyer at the point of sale .
There is a passing of title (property or ownership) of the item , and the settlement of a price , in which agreement is reached on a price for which transfer of ownership of the item will occur.
The seller , not the purchaser , typically executes the sale and it may be completed prior to the obligation of payment .
In the case of indirect interaction, a person who sells goods or service on behalf of the owner is known as a salesman or saleswoman or salesperson , but this often refers to someone selling goods in a store/shop, in which case other terms are also common, including salesclerk , shop assistant , and retail clerk .
In common law countries, sales are governed generally by the common law and commercial codes .
In the United States , the laws governing sales of goods are somewhat uniform to the extent that most jurisdictions have adopted Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code , albeit with some non-uniform variations.
Clothing (also known as clothes , apparel and attire ) is a collective term for items worn on the body.
Clothing is typically made of fabrics or textiles but over time has included garments made from animal skin or other thin sheets of materials put together.
The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies .
The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social, and geographic considerations.
Clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements , rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, insect bites , splinters , thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment.
Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body.
Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation .
Wearing clothes is also a social norm , and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing .
Not wearing clothes in public so that genitals , breasts (for women) or buttocks are visible could be considered indecent exposure .
A mother is the female parent of a child .
Mothers are women who inhabit or perform the role of bearing some relation to their children , who may or may not be their biological offspring .
Thus, dependent on the context, women can be considered mothers by virtue of having given birth , by raising their child(ren), supplying their ovum for fertilisation , or some combination thereof.
Such conditions provide a way of delineating the concept of motherhood, or the state of being a mother.
Women who meet the third and first categories usually fall under the terms 'birth mother' or 'biological mother', regardless of whether the individual in question goes on to parent their child.
Accordingly, a woman who meets only the second condition may be considered an adoptive mother, and those who meet only the first or only the third a surrogacy mother.
An adoptive mother is a female who has become the child's parent through the legal process of adoption .
A biological mother is the female genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual intercourse or egg donation .
A biological mother may have legal obligations to a child not raised by her, such as an obligation of monetary support.
A putative mother is a female whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established.
A stepmother is a female who is the wife of a child's father and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child.
The above concepts defining the role of mother are neither exhaustive nor universal, as any definition of 'mother' may vary based on how social, cultural, and religious roles are defined.
The parallel conditions and terms for males: those who are (typically biologically) fathers do not, by definition, take up the role of fatherhood.
Motherhood and fatherhood are not limited to those who are or have parented .
Women who are pregnant may be referred to as expectant mothers or mothers-to-be, though such applications tend to be less readily applied to (biological) fathers or adoptive parents.
The process of becoming a mother has been referred to as matrescence.
The adjective maternal refers to a mother and comparatively to paternal for a father .
The verb to mother means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun mothering.
Related terms of endearment are mom ( mama , mommy ), mum , mumsy , mamacita ( ma , mam ) and mammy .
A female role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a mother-figure .
Creativity is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed.
The created item may be intangible (such as an idea , a scientific theory , a musical composition , or a joke ) or a physical object (such as an invention , a literary work , or a painting ).
Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily psychology , business studies , and cognitive science , but also education , technology , engineering , philosophy (particularly philosophy of science ), theology , sociology , linguistics , and economics , covering the relations between creativity and general intelligence , personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or artificial intelligence ; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.
Interest is a feeling or emotion that causes attention to focus on an object, event, or process.
In contemporary psychology of interest, the term is used as a general concept that may encompass other more specific psychological terms, such as curiosity and to a much lesser degree surprise .
The emotion of interest does have its own facial expression , of which the most prominent component is having dilated pupils .
A bus (contracted from omnibus , with variants multibus , motorbus , autobus , etc.) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers .
Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers.
The most common type of bus is the single-deck rigid bus , with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses , and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses ; coaches are used for longer-distance services.
Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare.
Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare.
In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special licence above and beyond a regular driver's licence .
Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport , scheduled coach transport , school transport , private hire, or tourism ; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles.
Horse-drawn buses were used from the 1820s, followed by steam buses in the 1830s, and electric trolleybuses in 1882.
The first internal combustion engine buses, or motor buses, were used in 1895.
Recently, interest has been growing in hybrid electric buses , fuel cell buses , and electric buses , as well as buses powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel .
As of the 2010s, bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised , with the same designs appearing around the world.
Collegiality is the relationship between colleagues .
Colleague is taken to mean a fellow member of the same profession, a group of colleagues united in a common purpose, and used in proper names, such as Electoral College , College of Cardinals , and College of Pontiffs .
Colleagues are those explicitly united in a common purpose and respecting each other's abilities to work toward that purpose.
A colleague is an associate in a profession or in a civil or ecclesiastical office.
Collegiality can connote respect for another's commitment to the common purpose and ability to work toward it.
In a narrower sense, members of the faculty of a university or college are each other's colleagues.
Sociologists of organizations use the word collegiality in a technical sense, to create a contrast with the concept of bureaucracy .
Classical authors such as Max Weber consider collegiality as an organizational device used by autocrats to prevent experts and professionals from challenging monocratic and sometimes arbitrary powers.
More recently, authors such as Eliot Freidson (USA), Malcolm Waters (Australia) and Emmanuel Lazega (France) have shown that collegiality can now be understood as a full-fledged organizational form.
This is especially useful to account for coordination in knowledge intensive organizations in which interdependent members jointly perform non routine tasks – an increasingly frequent form of coordination in knowledge economies.
A specific, social discipline comes attached to this organizational form, a discipline described in terms of niche seeking, status competition, lateral control, and power among peers in corporate law partnerships, in dioceses, in scientific laboratories, etc.
This view of collegiality is obviously very different from the ideology of collegiality stressing mainly trust and sharing in the collegium.
A watch is a timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person.
It is designed to keep working despite the motions caused by the person's activities.
A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist , attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet .
A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket .
The study of timekeeping is known as horology .
Watches progressed in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th century.
During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork , powered by winding a mainspring , and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel .
These are called mechanical watches .
In the 1960s the electronic quartz watch was invented, which was powered by a battery and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal .
By the 1980s the quartz watch had taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch.
Historically, this is called the quartz revolution .
Developments in the 2010s include smartwatches , which are elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a wrist.
They generally incorporate timekeeping functions, but these are only a small subset of the smartwatch's facilities.
In general, modern watches often display the day, date, month and year.
For mechanical watches, various extra features called complications , such as moon-phase displays and the different types of tourbillon , are sometimes included.
Most electronic quartz watches, on the other hand, include time-related features such as timers , chronographs and alarm functions.
Furthermore, some modern smartwatches even incorporate calculators , GPS and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities, and some of them use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time.
Today, most watches in the market that are inexpensive and medium-priced, used mainly for timekeeping, have quartz movements .
However, expensive collectible watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal and glamorous design than for simple timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements, even though they are less accurate and more expensive than electronic ones.
As of 2018, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction is the Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication , which is the world's most complicated mechanical watch until 1989, fetching 24 million US dollars (23,237,000 CHF ) in Geneva on November 11, 2014.
Friday is the day of the week between Thursday and Saturday .
In countries adopting the Monday-first convention it is the fifth day of the week .
In countries that adopt the Sunday-first convention, it is the sixth and penultimate day of the week.
In some other countries, for example the Maldives , Friday is the first day of the weekend, with Saturday the second.
In Iran Friday is the last day of the weekend, with Saturday as the first day of the working week.
Bahrain , the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Kuwait also followed this convention until they changed to a Friday–Saturday weekend: on 1 September 2006 in Bahrain and the UAE, and a year later in Kuwait .
In Iran , Friday and Thursday are weekend days.

Genocide is intentional action to destroy a people (usually defined as an ethnic , national , racial , or religious group) in whole or in part.
The hybrid word genocide is a combination of the Greek word γένος (race, people) and the Latin suffix -caedo (act of killing).
The term genocide was coined by Raphael Lemkin in his 1944 book Axis Rule in Occupied Europe ;
The United Nations Genocide Convention , which was established in 1948, defines genocide as acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, including the systematic harm or killing of its members, deliberately imposing living conditions that seek to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, preventing births, or forcibly transferring children out of the group to another group.
The term has been applied to the Holocaust , and many other mass killings including the genocide of indigenous peoples in the Americas , the Armenian Genocide , the Greek genocide , the Assyrian genocide , the Serbian genocide , the Holodomor , the Indonesian genocide , the Guatemalan genocide , the 1971 Bangladesh genocide , the Cambodian genocide , and after 1980 the Bosnian genocide , the Anfal genocide , the Darfur genocide , and the Rwandan genocide .
Others are listed in Genocides in history and List of genocides by death toll .
The Political Instability Task Force estimated that, between 1956 and 2016, a total of 43 genocides took place, causing the death of about 50 million people .
The UNHCR estimated that a further 50 million had been displaced by such episodes of violence up to 2008.
In physics , a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object .
A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest ), i.e., to accelerate .
Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull.
A force has both magnitude and direction , making it a vector quantity.
It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F .
The original form of Newton's second law states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes with time.
If the mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
Concepts related to force include: thrust , which increases the velocity of an object; drag , which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque , which produces changes in rotational speed of an object.
In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress .
Such internal mechanical stresses cause no acceleration of that body as the forces balance one another.
Pressure , the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate.
Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids .
In biology , a species ( ( listen ) ) is the basic unit of classification and a taxonomic rank of an organism , as well as a unit of biodiversity .
A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which any two individuals of the appropriate sexes or mating types can produce fertile offspring , typically by sexual reproduction .
Other ways of defining species include their karyotype , DNA sequence, morphology , behaviour or ecological niche .
In addition, paleontologists use the concept of the chronospecies since fossil reproduction cannot be examined.
All species (except viruses) are given a two-part name , a binomial.
The first part of a binomial is the genus to which the species belongs.
The second part is called the specific name or the specific epithet (in botanical nomenclature , also sometimes in zoological nomenclature ).
For example, Boa constrictor is one of four species of the genus Boa .
While the definitions given above may seem adequate, when looked at more closely they represent problematic species concepts .
For example, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear with hybridisation , in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies , and in a ring species .
Also, among organisms that reproduce only asexually , the concept of a reproductive species breaks down, and each clone is potentially a microspecies .
Though none of these are entirely satisfactory definitions, scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work, regardless of the theoretical difficulties.
If species were fixed and clearly distinct from one another, there would be no problem, but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually, and to grade into one another.
Species were seen from the time of Aristotle until the 18th century as fixed categories that could be arranged in a hierarchy, the great chain of being .
In the 19th century, biologists grasped that species could evolve given sufficient time.
Charles Darwin 's 1859 book The Origin of Species explained how species could arise by natural selection .
That understanding was greatly extended in the 20th century through genetics and population ecology .
Genetic variability arises from mutations and recombination , while organisms themselves are mobile, leading to geographical isolation and genetic drift with varying selection pressures.
Genes can sometimes be exchanged between species by horizontal gene transfer ; new species can arise rapidly through hybridisation and polyploidy ; and species may become extinct for a variety of reasons.
Viruses are a special case, driven by a balance of mutation and selection , and can be treated as quasispecies .
A student is primarily a person enrolled in a school or other educational institution who attends classes in a course to attain the appropriate level of mastery of a subject under the guidance of an instructor and who devotes time outside class to do whatever activities the instructor assigns that are necessary either for class preparation or to submit evidence of progress towards that mastery.
In the broader sense, a student is anyone who applies themselves to the intensive intellectual engagement with some matter necessary to master it as part of some practical affair in which such mastery is basic or decisive.
In the United Kingdom and India, the term student denotes those enrolled in secondary schools and higher (e.g., college or university ); those enrolled in primary/elementary schools are called pupils.
Generally, a fishery is an entity engaged in raising or harvesting fish which is determined by some authority to be a fishery.
According to the FAO , a fishery is typically defined in terms of the people involved, species or type of fish, area of water or seabed, method of fishing, class of boats, purpose of the activities or a combination of the foregoing features.
The definition often includes a combination of fish and fishers in a region, the latter fishing for similar species with similar gear types.
A fishery may involve the capture of wild fish or raising fish through fish farming or aquaculture .
Directly or indirectly, the livelihood of over 500 million people in developing countries depends on fisheries and aquaculture.
Overfishing , including the taking of fish beyond sustainable levels , is reducing fish stocks and employment in many world regions.
A report by Prince Charles ' International Sustainability Unit, the New York-based Environmental Defence Fund and 50in10 published in July 2014 estimated global fisheries were adding $270 billion a year to global GDP, but by full implementation of sustainable fishing, that figure could rise by as much as $50 billion.
A girl is a young female human , usually a child or an adolescent .
When she becomes an adult, she is described as a woman .
The term girl may also be used to mean a young woman , and is sometimes used as a synonym for daughter .
Girl may also be a term of endearment used by an adult, usually a woman, to designate adult female friends.
The treatment and status of girls in any society is usually closely related to the status of women in that culture.
In cultures where women have a low societal position, girls may be unwanted by their parents, and the state may invest less in services for girls.
Girls' upbringing ranges from being relatively the same as that of boys to complete sex segregation and completely different gender roles .
Wi-Fi ( ) is a family of radio technologies commonly used for wireless local area networking (WLAN) of devices, It is based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards.
Wi‑Fi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance , which restricts the use of the term Wi-Fi Certified to products that successfully complete interoperability certification testing.
The Wi-Fi Alliance includes 3Com (now owned by HP), Aironet (now owned by Cisco ), Harris Semiconductor (now owned by Intersil ), Lucent (now owned by Nokia ), Nokia and Symbol Technologies (now owned by Zebra Technologies ).
Wi-Fi uses multiple parts of the IEEE 802 protocol family and is designed to seamlessly interwork with its wired sister protocol Ethernet .
Devices that can use Wi-Fi technologies include desktops and laptops, smartphones and tablets , smart TVs , printers , digital audio players, digital cameras , cars and drones .
Compatible devices can connect to each other over Wi-Fi through a wireless access point as well as to connected Ethernet devices and may use it to access the Internet.
Such an access point (or hotspot ) has a range of about 20 meters (66 feet) indoors and a greater range outdoors.
Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometres achieved by using multiple overlapping access points.
The different versions of Wi-Fi are specified by various IEEE 802.11 protocol standards, with the different radio technologies determining the ranges, radio bands, and speeds that may be achieved.
Wi-Fi most commonly uses the 2.4 gigahertz (12 cm) UHF and 5 gigahertz (6 cm) SHF ISM radio bands; these bands are subdivided into multiple channels.
Each channel can be time-shared by multiple networks.
These wavelengths work best for line-of-sight .
Many common materials absorb or reflect them, which further restricts range, but can tend to help minimise interference between different networks in crowded environments.
At close range, some versions of Wi-Fi, running on suitable hardware, can achieve speeds of over 1 Gb/s ( Gigabit per second).
Wi-Fi is potentially more vulnerable to attack than wired networks because anyone within range of a network with a wireless network interface controller can attempt access.
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a family of technologies created to protect information moving across Wi-Fi networks and includes solutions for personal and enterprise networks.
Security features of WPA have included stronger protections and new security practices as the security landscape has changed over time.

The opossum ( or ) is a marsupial of the order Didelphimorphia ( ) endemic to the Americas .
The largest order of marsupials in the Western Hemisphere , it comprises 103 or more species in 19 genera .
Opossums originated in South America and entered North America in the Great American Interchange following the connection of the two continents.
Their unspecialized biology, flexible diet, and reproductive habits make them successful colonizers and survivors in diverse locations and conditions.
In the United States and Canada, the only species found is the Virginia opossum , and it is generally referred to as a possum - but should not be confused with the suborder Phalangeriformes , which are arboreal marsupials in the Eastern Hemisphere also called possums because of their resemblance to Didelphimorphia.
Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada , with a population of 2,731,571 in 2016.
Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most populous CMA .
The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe , an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario .
Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.
People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area, situated on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers, deep ravines, and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years.
After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase , when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown , the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada .
During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by United States troops .
York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto .
It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation .
The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km (243.3 sq mi).
The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada .
More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group, and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants.
While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city.
Toronto is a prominent centre for music, theatre, motion picture production, and television production, and is home to the headquarters of Canada's major national broadcast networks and media outlets.
Its varied cultural institutions , which include numerous museums and galleries , festivals and public events , entertainment districts, national historic sites , and sports activities , attract over 25 million tourists each year.
Toronto is known for its many skyscrapers and high-rise buildings , in particular the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere , the CN Tower .
The city is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange , the headquarters of Canada's five largest banks , and the headquarters of many large Canadian and multinational corporations.
Its economy is highly diversified with strengths in technology, design, financial services, life sciences, education, arts, fashion, business services, environmental innovation, food services, and tourism.
An illusion is a distortion of the senses , which can reveal how the human brain normally organizes and interprets sensory stimulation .
Though illusions distort our perception of reality, they are generally shared by most people.
Illusions may occur with any of the human senses, but visual illusions ( optical illusions ) are the best-known and understood.
The emphasis on visual illusions occurs because vision often dominates the other senses.
For example, individuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the voice is coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words.
Some illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes during perception .
These assumptions are made using organizational principles (e.g., Gestalt theory), an individual's capacity for depth perception and motion perception, and perceptual constancy .
Other illusions occur because of biological sensory structures within the human body or conditions outside the body within one's physical environment.
The term illusion refers to a specific form of sensory distortion.
Unlike a hallucination , which is a distortion in the absence of a stimulus , an illusion describes a misinterpretation of a true sensation.
For example, hearing voices regardless of the environment would be a hallucination, whereas hearing voices in the sound of running water (or another auditory source) would be an illusion.

Egypt ( ( listen ) EE -jipt ; Arabic : مِصر ‎ Miṣr , Egyptian Arabic : مَصر ‎ Maṣr , Coptic : Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ K ēmi ), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt , is a country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula .
Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west.
Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt.
Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country, tracing its heritage back to the 6th–4th millennia BCE.
Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government.
Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest.
Egypt's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity, which has endured, and often assimilated, various foreign influences, including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian .
Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country, albeit with a significant Christian minority .
From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century, Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers: The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire .
Modern Egypt dates back to 1922, when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy.
However, British military occupation of Egypt continued, and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism.
Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation, nationalized the British-held Suez Canal, exiled King Farouk and his family, and declared itself a republic .
In 1958 it merged with Syria to form the United Arab Republic , which dissolved in 1961.
Throughout the second half of the 20th century, Egypt endured social and religious strife and political instability, fighting several armed conflicts with Israel in 1948 , 1956 , 1967 and 1973 , and occupying the Gaza Strip intermittently until 1967.
In 1978, Egypt signed the Camp David Accords , officially withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and recognising Israel .
The country continues to face challenges, from political unrest, including the recent 2011 revolution and its aftermath , to terrorism and economic underdevelopment.
Egypt's current government is a semi-presidential republic headed by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi , which has been described by a number of watchdogs as authoritarian.
Islam is the official religion of Egypt and Arabic is its official language.
With over 95 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa , the Middle East , and the Arab world , the third-most populous in Africa (after Nigeria and Ethiopia ), and the fifteenth-most populous in the world.
The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River, an area of about 40,000 square kilometres (15,000 sq mi), where the only arable land is found.
The large regions of the Sahara desert , which constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited.
About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo , Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta .
The sovereign state of Egypt is a transcontinental country considered to be a regional power in North Africa , the Middle East and the Muslim world , and a middle power worldwide.
Egypt's economy is one of the largest and most diversified in the Middle East, and is projected to become one of the largest in the world in the 21st century.
In 2016, Egypt overtook South Africa and became Africa's second largest economy (after Nigeria ).
Egypt is a founding member of the United Nations , Non-Aligned Movement , Arab League , African Union , and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation .
Black is the darkest color, the result of the absence or complete absorption of visible light .
It is an achromatic color, a color without hue , like white and gray .
It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness, while white represents light.
Black and white have often been used to describe opposites such as good and evil , the Dark Ages versus Age of Enlightenment , and night versus day .
Since the Middle Ages , black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates, including the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court .
Black was one of the first colors used by artists in neolithic cave paintings.
In the 14th century, it was worn by royalty, clergy, judges and government officials in much of Europe.
It became the color worn by English romantic poets, businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century, and a high fashion color in the 20th century.
In the Roman Empire , it became the color of mourning, and over the centuries it was frequently associated with death , evil, witches and magic.
According to surveys in Europe and North America, it is the color most commonly associated with mourning, the end, secrets, magic, force, violence, evil, and elegance.
Black ink is the most common color used for printing books, newspapers and documents, as it provides the highest contrast with white paper and thus the easiest color to read.
Similarly, black text on a white screen is the most common format used on computer screens.
The chief executive officer ( CEO ) or just chief executive ( CE ), is the most senior corporate , executive , or administrative officer in charge of managing an organization – especially an independent legal entity such as a company or nonprofit institution .
CEOs lead a range of organizations, including public and private corporations , non-profit organizations and even some government organizations (notably Crown corporations ).
The CEO of a corporation or company typically reports to the board of directors and is charged with maximizing the value of the entity, which may include maximizing the share price, market share, revenues or another element.
In the non-profit and government sector, CEOs typically aim at achieving outcomes related to the organization's mission, such as reducing poverty, increasing literacy, etc.
In the early 21st century, top executives typically had technical degrees in science, engineering or law.
A bicycle , also called a cycle or bike , is a human-powered or motor-powered , pedal-driven , single-track vehicle , having two wheels attached to a frame , one behind the other.
A bicycle rider is called a cyclist , or bicyclist.
Bicycles were introduced in the late 19th century in Europe, and by the early 21st century, more than 1 billion were in existence at a given time.
These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of individual models produced.
They are the principal means of transportation in many regions.
They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys, general fitness , military and police applications, courier services , bicycle racing and bicycle stunts.
The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright or safety bicycle , has changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885.
However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design .
These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of cycling.
The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods.
Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings , pneumatic tires , chain-driven sprockets and tension-spoked wheels .
Reform ( Latin : reformo ) means the improvement or amendment of what is wrong, corrupt, unsatisfactory, etc.
The use of the word in this way emerges in the late 18th century and is believed to originate from Christopher Wyvills Association movement which identified “Parliamentary Reform” as its primary aim.
Reform is generally distinguished from revolution .
The latter means basic or radical change; whereas reform may be no more than fine tuning, or at most redressing serious wrongs without altering the fundamentals of the system.
Reform seeks to improve the system as it stands, never to overthrow it wholesale.
Radicals on the other hand, seek to improve the system, but try to overthrow whether it be the government or a group of people themselves.
In the United States, rotation in office or term limits would, by contrast, be more revolutionary, in altering basic political connections between incumbents and constituents.
Developing countries may carry out a wide range of reforms to improve their living standards, often with support from international financial institutions and aid agencies .
This can include reforms to macroeconomic policy , the civil service , and public financial management .

A photograph (also known as a photo ) is an image created by light falling on a photosensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic image sensor , such as a CCD or a CMOS chip.
Most photographs are created using a camera , which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see.
The process and practice of creating such images is called photography .
The word photograph was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek φῶς ( phos ), meaning light, and γραφή ( graphê ), meaning drawing, writing, together meaning drawing with light.
Binding may refer to:
Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties.
Those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates .
The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC, when the Sea Peoples , a group of ocean raiders, attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilizations.
Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy, as well as for privateering and commerce raiding .
Historic examples include the waters of Gibraltar , the Strait of Malacca , Madagascar, the Gulf of Aden , and the English Channel, whose geographic structures facilitated pirate attacks.
A land-based parallel is the ambushing of travelers by bandits and brigands in highways and mountain passes.
Privateering uses similar methods to piracy, but the captain acts under orders of the state authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation, making it a legitimate form of war -like activity by non-state actors .
While the term can include acts committed in the air , on land (especially across national borders or in connection with taking over and robbing a car or train ), or in other major bodies of water or on a shore , in cyberspace , as well as the fictional possibility of space piracy, this article focuses on maritime piracy.
It does not normally include crimes committed against people traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator (e.g. one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel).
Piracy or pirating is the name of a specific crime under customary international law and also the name of a number of crimes under the municipal law of a number of states.
In the early 21st century , seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue (with estimated worldwide losses of US$16 billion per year in 2004), particularly in the waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean , off the Somali coast , and also in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore .
Today, pirates armed with automatic weapons, such as assault rifles , and machine guns , grenades and rocket propelled grenades use small motorboats to attack and board ships, a tactic that takes advantage of the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels and transport ships.
They also use larger vessels, known as mother ships, to supply the smaller motorboats.
The international community is facing many challenges in bringing modern pirates to justice , as these attacks often occur in international waters .
Some nations have used their naval forces to protect private ships from pirate attacks and to pursue pirates, and some private vessels use armed security guards, high-pressure water cannons , or sound cannons to repel boarders, and use radar to avoid potential threats.
A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming .
Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs .
These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.
A complete computer including the hardware , the operating system (main software ), and peripheral equipment required and used for full operation can be referred to as a computer system .
This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster .
Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices .
This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls , factory devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design , and also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones .
The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users.
Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices.
Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the abacus aided people in doing calculations.
Early in the Industrial Revolution , some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms .
More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century.
The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II .
The first transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the MOS transistor and integrated circuit in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s.
The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with MOS transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace, as predicted by Moore's law .
Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element , typically a central processing unit (CPU), and some form of memory .
The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information .
Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen ).
Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.
Size is the magnitude or dimensions of a thing.
Size can be measured as length , width , height , diameter , perimeter , area , volume , or mass .
In mathematical terms, size is a concept abstracted from the process of measuring by comparing a longer to a shorter.
Size is determined by the process of comparing or measuring objects, which results in the determination of the magnitude of a quantity, such as length or mass, relative to a unit of measurement.
Such a magnitude is usually expressed as a numerical value of units on a previously established spatial scale , such as meters or inches .
The sizes with which humans tend to be most familiar are body dimensions (measures of anthropometry ), which include measures such as human height , and human body weight .
These measures can, in the aggregate, allow the generation of commercially useful distributions of products that accommodate expected body sizes, as with the creation of clothing sizes and shoe sizes , and with the standardization of door frame dimensions, ceiling heights, and bed sizes .
The human experience of size can lead to a psychological tendency towards size bias, wherein the relative importance or perceived complexity of organisms and other objects is judged based on their size relative to humans, and particularly whether this size makes them easy to observe without aid.
A goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envisions, plans and commits to achieve.
People endeavor to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines .
A goal is roughly similar to a purpose or aim, the anticipated result which guides reaction, or an end , which is an object , either a physical object or an abstract object , that has intrinsic value .
Power typically refers to:

Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses , to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage.
The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture , speech, song, music , and dance .
Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.
The specific place of the performance is also named by the word theatre as derived from the Ancient Greek θέατρον (théatron, a place for viewing), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, to see, to watch, to observe).
Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the theatre of ancient Greece , from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock characters , and plot elements.
Theatre artist Patrice Pavis defines theatricality, theatrical language , stage writing and the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other performing arts , literature and the arts in general.
Modern theatre includes performances of plays and musical theatre .
The art forms of ballet and opera are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes and staging.
They were influential to the development of musical theatre; see those articles for more information.
Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person's consent .
The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion , abuse of authority , or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent .
The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault.
The rate of reporting, prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions.
Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged, per 100,000 people, from 0.2 in Azerbaijan to 92.9 in Botswana with 6.3 in Lithuania as the median .
Worldwide, rape is primarily committed by males.
Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows, and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape.
Widespread and systematic rape (e.g., war rape ) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict.
These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes .
Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group.
People who have been raped can be traumatized and develop posttraumatic stress disorder .
Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections .
A person may face violence or threats from the rapist, and, in some cultures, from the victim's family and relatives.

Risk is the possibility of losing something of value.
Values (such as physical health , social status , emotional well-being, or financial wealth) can be gained or lost when taking risk resulting from a given action or inaction, foreseen or unforeseen (planned or not planned).
Risk can also be defined as the intentional interaction with uncertainty .
Uncertainty is a potential, unpredictable, and uncontrollable outcome; risk is an aspect of action taken in spite of uncertainty.
Risk perception is the subjective judgment people make about the severity and probability of a risk, and may vary person to person.
Any human endeavour carries some risk, but some are much riskier than others.
Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time.
General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony ), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo , meter , and articulation ), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the color of a musical sound).
Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements.
Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping ; there are solely instrumental pieces , solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment ) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.
The word derives from Greek μουσική ( mousike ; art of the Muses ).
See glossary of musical terminology .
In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music ( songs , tunes, symphonies , and so on), the criticism of music , the study of the history of music , and the aesthetic examination of music .
Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies.
Common sayings such as the harmony of the spheres and it is music to my ears point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to.
However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, There is no noise , only sound.
The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context.
Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as not being music, including Beethoven 's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825, early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and hardcore punk in the 1980s.
There are many types of music, including popular music , traditional music , art music , music written for religious ceremonies and work songs such as chanteys .
Music ranges from strictly organized compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played improvisational music such as jazz , and avant-garde styles of chance-based contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries.
Music can be divided into genres (e.g., country music ) and genres can be further divided into subgenres (e.g., country blues and pop country are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial.
For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s hard rock and heavy metal .
Within the arts , music may be classified as a performing art , a fine art or as an auditory art.
Music may be played or sung and heard live at a rock concert or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a dramatic work (a music theater show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, CD player , smartphone or as film score or TV show.
In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in religious rituals , rite of passage ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., dancing ) and cultural activities ranging from amateur karaoke singing to playing in an amateur funk band or singing in a community choir .
People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a youth orchestra , or work as a professional musician or singer.
The music industry includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, jazz band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and sound engineers ), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings, sheet music , and scores to customers.
A scholar is a person who devotes themselves to scholarly pursuits, particularly to the study of an area in which they have developed expertise .
A scholar may also be an academic , a person who works as a teacher or researcher at a university or other higher education institution.
An academic usually holds an advanced degree .
A resource is a main source or supply from which a benefit is produced and it has some utility.
Resources can broadly be classified upon their availability — they are classified into renewable and non-renewable resources.
Examples of non renewable resources are coal, crude oil natural gas etc.
Examples of renewable resources are air, water, wind, solar energy etc.
They can also be classified as actual and potential on the basis of level of development and use, on the basis of origin they can be classified as biotic and abiotic, and on the basis of their distribution, as ubiquitous and localized (private resources, community-owned resources, natural resources, international resources).
An item becomes a resource with time and developing technology.
Typically, resources are materials, energy, services, staff, knowledge, or other assets that are transformed to produce benefit and in the process may be consumed or made unavailable.
Benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well-being.
From a human perspective a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants.
From a broader biological or ecological perspective a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource ).
The concept of resources has been developed across many established areas of work, in economics , biology and ecology , computer science , management , and human resources for example - linked to the concepts of competition , sustainability , conservation , and stewardship .
In application within human society , commercial or non-commercial factors require resource allocation through resource management .
Matthew may refer to:
Planning is the process of thinking about the activities required to achieve a desired goal .
It is the first and foremost activity to achieve desired results.
It involves the creation and maintenance of a plan , such as psychological aspects that require conceptual skills.
There are even a couple of tests to measure someones capability of planning well.
As such, planning is a fundamental property of intelligent behavior.
An important further meaning, often just called planning is the legal context of permitted building developments .
Also, planning has a specific process and is necessary for multiple occupations (particularly in fields such as management , business , etc.).
In each field there are different types of plans that help companies achieve efficiency and effectiveness.
An important, albeit often ignored aspect of planning, is the relationship it holds to forecasting .
Forecasting can be described as predicting what the future will look like, whereas planning predicts what the future should look like for multiple scenarios.
Planning combines forecasting with preparation of scenarios and how to react to them.
Planning is one of the most important project management and time management techniques.
Planning is preparing a sequence of action steps to achieve some specific goal.
If a person does it effectively, they can reduce much the necessary time and effort of achieving the goal.
A plan is like a map.
When following a plan, a person can see how much they have progressed towards their project goal and how far they are from their destination.
Fellows may refer to Fellow , in plural form.
Fellows or Fellowes may also refer to:
A hole is an opening in or through a particular medium, usually a solid body.
Holes occur through natural and artificial processes, and may be useful for various purposes, or may represent a problem needing to be addressed in many fields of engineering.
Depending on the material and the placement, a hole may be an indentation in a surface (such as a hole in the ground), or may pass completely through that surface (such as a hole created by a hole puncher in a piece of paper).
In engineering, a hole may be blind or through if it is partial or complete depth.
1 ( one , also called unit , unity , and (multiplicative) identity ) is a number , and a numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals .
It represents a single entity, the unit of counting or measurement .
For example, a line segment of unit length is a line segment of length 1.
It is also the first of the infinite sequence of natural numbers , followed by 2 .
London is the capital of and largest city in England and the United Kingdom , with the largest municipal population in the European Union .
Standing on the River Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea , London has been a major settlement for two millennia.
Londinium was founded by the Romans .
The City of London , London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km ) and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits.
The City of Westminster is also an Inner London borough holding city status .
Greater London is governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly .
London is considered to be one of the world's most important global cities and has been termed the world's most powerful, most desirable, most influential, most visited, most expensive, innovative, sustainable, most investment friendly, most popular for work, and the most vegetarian-friendly city in the world.
London exerts a considerable impact upon the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transportation.
London ranks 26 out of 300 major cities for economic performance.
It is one of the largest financial centres and has either the fifth or sixth largest metropolitan area GDP .
It is the most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the busiest city airport system as measured by passenger traffic.
It is the leading investment destination, hosting more international retailers and ultra high-net-worth individuals than any other city.
London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe.
In 2012 , London became the first city to have hosted three modern Summer Olympic Games .
London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region.
Its estimated mid-2016 municipal population (corresponding to Greater London ) was 8,787,892, the most populous of any city in the European Union and accounting for 13.4% of the UK population.
London's urban area is the second most populous in the EU , after Paris , with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census.
The population within the London commuter belt is the most populous in the EU with 14,040,163 inhabitants in 2016.
London was the world's most populous city from c.
1831 to 1925.
London contains four World Heritage Sites : the Tower of London ; Kew Gardens ; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster , Westminster Abbey , and St Margaret's Church ; and the historic settlement in Greenwich where the Royal Observatory, Greenwich defines the Prime Meridian , 0° longitude , and Greenwich Mean Time .
Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace , the London Eye , Piccadilly Circus , St Paul's Cathedral , Tower Bridge , Trafalgar Square and The Shard .
London has numerous museums , galleries, libraries and sporting events .
These include the British Museum , National Gallery , Natural History Museum , Tate Modern , British Library and West End theatres .
The London Underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world.
A window is an opening in a wall , door , roof or vehicle that allows the passage of light, sound, and sometimes air.
Modern windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material, a sash set in a frame in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window.
Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather.
Windows often have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts.
Types include the eyebrow window, fixed windows, single-hung and double-hung sash windows, horizontal sliding sash windows , casement windows , awning windows, hopper windows, tilt and slide windows (often door-sized), tilt and turn windows, transom windows, sidelight windows, jalousie or louvered windows, clerestory windows, skylights, roof windows, roof lanterns, bay windows, oriel windows, thermal, or Diocletian, windows, picture windows, emergency exit windows, stained glass windows, French windows, panel windows, and double - and triple paned windows.
The Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in Roman Egypt , in Alexandria ca.
Paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient China , Korea and Japan .
In England , glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century.
In the 19th century American west, greased paper windows came to be used by itinerant groups.
Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial plate glass making processes were fully perfected.
A tsunami (from Japanese : 津波 , lit.
'harbour wave'; English pronunciation: soo- NAH -mee or ) or tidal wave , is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an ocean or a large lake .
Earthquakes , volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions (including detonations, landslides, glacier calvings , meteorite impacts and other disturbances) above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami.
Unlike normal ocean waves, which are generated by wind , or tides , which are generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water.
Tsunami waves do not resemble normal undersea currents or sea waves because their wavelength is far longer.
Rather than appearing as a breaking wave, a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide .
For this reason, it is often referred to as a tidal wave, although this usage is not favoured by the scientific community because it might give the false impression of a causal relationship between tides and tsunamis.
Tsunamis generally consist of a series of waves, with periods ranging from minutes to hours, arriving in a so-called internal wave train .
Wave heights of tens of metres can be generated by large events.
Although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas, their destructive power can be enormous, and they can affect entire ocean basins.
The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was among the deadliest natural disasters in human history, with at least 230,000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the Indian Ocean .
The Ancient Greek historian Thucydides suggested in his 5th century BC History of the Peloponnesian War that tsunamis were related to submarine earthquakes , but the understanding of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century and much remains unknown.
Major areas of current research include determining why some large earthquakes do not generate tsunamis while other smaller ones do; accurately forecasting the passage of tsunamis across the oceans; and forecasting how tsunami waves interact with shorelines.
Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish .
Fish are normally caught in the wild .
Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering , spearing , netting , angling and trapping .
“Fishing” may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs , cephalopods , crustaceans , and echinoderms .
The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish , or to aquatic mammals , such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate.
In addition to being caught to be eaten , fish are caught as recreational pastimes .
Fishing tournaments are held, and caught fish are sometimes kept as preserved or living trophies .
When bioblitzes occur, fish are typically caught, identified, and then released.
According to the United Nations FAO statistics, the total number of commercial fishermen and fish farmers is estimated to be 38 million.
Fisheries and aquaculture provide direct and indirect employment to over 500 million people in developing countries.
In 2005, the worldwide per capita consumption of fish captured from wild fisheries was 14.4 kilograms, with an additional 7.4 kilograms harvested from fish farms.
Reality is the sum or aggregate of all that is real or existent, as opposed to that which is merely imaginary .
The term is also used to refer to the ontological status of things, indicating their existence.
In physical terms, reality is the totality of the universe , known and unknown.
Philosophical questions about the nature of reality or existence or being are considered under the rubric of ontology , which is a major branch of metaphysics in the Western philosophical tradition.
Ontological questions also feature in diverse branches of philosophy, including the philosophy of science , philosophy of religion , philosophy of mathematics , and philosophical logic .
These include questions about whether only physical objects are real (i.e., Physicalism ), whether reality is fundamentally immaterial (e.g., Idealism ), whether hypothetical unobservable entities posited by scientific theories exist, whether God exists, whether numbers and other abstract objects exist, and whether possible worlds exist.

Information is the resolution of uncertainty ; it is that which answers the question of what an entity is and thus defines both its essence and nature of its characteristics.
Information relates to both data and knowledge , as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of a concept.
In terms of communication, information is expressed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation .
That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, information is always conveyed as the content of a message.
Information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation (for example, information may be encoded into a sequence of signs , or transmitted via a signal ).
It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication.
The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence and is inversely proportional to that.
The more uncertain an event, the more information is required to resolve uncertainty of that event.
The bit is a typical unit of information , but other units such as the nat may be used.
For example, the information encoded in one fair coin flip is log 2 (2/1) = 1 bit, and in two fair coin flips islog 2 (4/1) = 2 bits.
The concept of information has different meanings in different contexts.
Thus the concept becomes related to notions of constraint , communication , control , data , form , education , knowledge , meaning , understanding , mental stimuli , pattern , perception , representation , and entropy .
Innovation in its modern meaning is a new idea, creative thoughts, new imaginations in form of device or method.
Innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs.
Such innovation takes place through the provision of more-effective products , processes , services , technologies , or business models that are made available to markets , governments and society .
An innovation is something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that breaks into the market or society.
Innovation is related to, but not the same as, invention , as innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention (ie new / improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in the market or society, and not all innovations require an invention.
Innovation often manifests itself via the engineering process, when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature.
The opposite of innovation is exnovation .
While a novel device is often described as an innovation, in economics, management science , and other fields of practice and analysis, innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in such a way that they affect society.
In industrial economics , innovations are created and found empirically from services to meet growing consumer demand .
Innovation also has an older historical meaning which is quite different.
From the 1400s through the 1600s, prior to early American settlement, the concept of innovation was pejorative.
It was an early modern synonym for rebellion, revolt and heresy.
Lab usually refers to:
Lab or LAB , or variant may also refer to:
In computer technology and telecommunications , online indicates a state of connectivity , and offline indicates a disconnected state.
In modern terminology this usually refers to an Internet connection , but (especially when expressed on line or on the line) could refer to any piece of equipment or functional unit that is connected to a larger system.
Being online means that the equipment or subsystem is connected, or that it is ready for use.
Online has come to describe activities performed on and data available on the Internet, for example: online identity , online predator , online gambling , online shopping , online banking , and online learning .
Similar meaning is also given by the prefixes cyber and e, as in the words cyberspace , cybercrime , email , and ecommerce .
In contrast, offline can refer to either computing activities performed while disconnected from the Internet, or alternatives to Internet activities (such as shopping in brick-and-mortar stores).
The term offline is sometimes used interchangeably with the acronym IRL, meaning in real life.
Africa is the world's second largest and second most-populous continent , being behind Asia in both categories.
At about 30.3 million km (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20% of its land area.
With1.2 billion people as of 2016, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population .
The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.
The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos .
It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states ( countries ), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition .
The majority of the continent and its countries are in the Northern Hemisphere , with a substantial portion and number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere .
Africa's average population is the youngest amongst all the continents; the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4. Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population.
Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa , is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade ( great apes ), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors as well as later ones that have been dated to around 7 million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis , Australopithecus africanus , A.
afarensis , Homo erectus , H.
habilis and H.
ergaster —the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human), found in Ethiopia , date to circa 200,000 years ago.
Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.
Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities , cultures and languages .
In the late 19th century , European countries colonised almost all of Africa ; most present states in Africa emerged from a process of decolonisation in the 20th century.
African nations cooperate through the establishment of the African Union , which is headquartered in Addis Ababa .
Shift may refer to:
A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs .
Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons.
They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines.
There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries .
Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world.
In botany , a fruit is the seed -bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering .
Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds .
Edible fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition ; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.
Accordingly, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate ) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.
In common language usage, fruit normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state, such as apples , bananas , grapes , lemons , oranges , and strawberries .
On the other hand, in botanical usage, fruit includes many structures that are not commonly called fruits, such as bean pods, corn kernels , tomatoes , and wheat grains.
The section of a fungus that produces spores is also called a fruiting body.
A hand is a prehensile , multi- fingered appendage located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans , chimpanzees , monkeys , and lemurs .
A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each hand and fingerprints extremely similar to human fingerprints ) are often described as having hands instead of paws on their front limbs.
The raccoon is usually described as having hands though opposable thumbs are lacking.
Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally — for example, in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand.
The human hand normally has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb ; these are often referred to collectively as five fingers, however, whereby the thumb is included as one of the fingers.
It has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bone , the number of which varies between people, 14 of which are the phalanges ( proximal , intermediate and distal ) of the fingers and thumb.
The metacarpal bones connect the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist .
Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones.
Fingers contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings in the body, and are the richest source of tactile feedback.
They also have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus, the sense of touch is intimately associated with hands.
Like other paired organs (eyes, feet, legs) each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere , so that handedness —the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning.
Among humans, the hands play an important function in body language and sign language .
Likewise the ten digits of two hands, and the twelve phalanges of four fingers (touchable by the thumb) have given rise to number systems and calculation techniques.

Magic or Magick may also refer to:
A microphone , colloquially named mic or mike ( ), is a device – a transducer – that converts sound into an electrical signal .
Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones , hearing aids , public address systems for concert halls and public events, motion picture production, live and recorded audio engineering , sound recording , two-way radios , megaphones , radio and television broadcasting, and in computers for recording voice, speech recognition , VoIP , and for non-acoustic purposes such as ultrasonic sensors or knock sensors .
Several types of microphone are in use, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure variations of a sound wave to an electrical signal.
The most common are the dynamic microphone , which uses a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field; the condenser microphone , which uses the vibrating diaphragm as a capacitor plate; and the piezoelectric microphone , which uses a crystal of piezoelectric material.
Microphones typically need to be connected to a preamplifier before the signal can be recorded or reproduced .
Marine is an adjective meaning of or pertaining to the sea or ocean .
Marine or marines may refer to:
An explosion is a rapid increase in volume and release of energy in an extreme manner, usually with the generation of high temperatures and the release of gases .
Supersonic explosions created by high explosives are known as detonations and travel via supersonic shock waves .
Subsonic explosions are created by low explosives through a slower burning process known as deflagration .
A watch is a timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person.
It is designed to keep working despite the motions caused by the person's activities.
A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist , attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet .
A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket .
The study of timekeeping is known as horology .
Watches progressed in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th century.
During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork , powered by winding a mainspring , and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel .
These are called mechanical watches .
In the 1960s the electronic quartz watch was invented, which was powered by a battery and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal .
By the 1980s the quartz watch had taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch.
Historically, this is called the quartz revolution .
Developments in the 2010s include smartwatches , which are elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a wrist.
They generally incorporate timekeeping functions, but these are only a small subset of the smartwatch's facilities.
In general, modern watches often display the day, date, month and year.
For mechanical watches, various extra features called complications , such as moon-phase displays and the different types of tourbillon , are sometimes included.
Most electronic quartz watches, on the other hand, include time-related features such as timers , chronographs and alarm functions.
Furthermore, some modern smartwatches even incorporate calculators , GPS and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities, and some of them use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time.
Today, most watches in the market that are inexpensive and medium-priced, used mainly for timekeeping, have quartz movements .
However, expensive collectible watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal and glamorous design than for simple timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements, even though they are less accurate and more expensive than electronic ones.
As of 2018, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction is the Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication , which is the world's most complicated mechanical watch until 1989, fetching 24 million US dollars (23,237,000 CHF ) in Geneva on November 11, 2014.
A centimetre ( international spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures ; symbol cm ) or centimeter ( American spelling ) is a unit of length in the metric system , equal to one hundredth of a metre , centi being the SI prefix for a factor of 1 / 100 .
The centimetre was the base unit of length in the now deprecated centimetre–gram–second (CGS) system of units.
Though for many physical quantities, SI prefixes for factors of 10 —like milli- and kilo- —are often preferred by technicians, the centimetre remains a practical unit of length for many everyday measurements.
A centimetre is approximately the width of the fingernail of an average adult person.
A pattern is a regularity in the world, in human-made design, or in abstract ideas.
As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner.
A geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and typically repeated like a wallpaper design.
Any of the senses may directly observe patterns.
Conversely, abstract patterns in science , mathematics , or language may be observable only by analysis.
Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art.
Visual patterns in nature are often chaotic , never exactly repeating, and often involve fractals .
Natural patterns include spirals , meanders , waves , foams , tilings , cracks , and those created by symmetries of rotation and reflection .
Patterns have an underlying mathematical structure; indeed, mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities, and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern.
Similarly in the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world.
In art and architecture, decorations or visual motifs may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer.
In computer science, a software design pattern is a known solution to a class of problems in programming.
In fashion, the pattern is a template used to create any number of similar garments.
Oh , OH or Oh! is an interjection, proclaiming surprise (emotion) .
It may refer to:
A habit (or wont as a humorous and formal term) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.
The American Journal of Psychology (1903) defines a habit, from the standpoint of psychology, as a more or less fixed way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience.
Habitual behavior often goes unnoticed in persons exhibiting it, because a person does not need to engage in self-analysis when undertaking routine tasks.
Habits are sometimes compulsory.
A 2002 daily experience study by habit researcher Wendy Wood and her colleagues found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit.
New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation .
Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns which humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.
A 2007 study by Wood and Neal found that when behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action.
This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context.
Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of:
Litter consists of waste products that have been disposed of improperly, without consent, at an undesirable location.
Litter can also be used as a verb.
To litter means to drop and leave objects, often man-made, such as aluminum cans, cardboard boxes or plastic bottles on the ground, and leave them there indefinitely or for others to dispose of as opposed to disposing of them properly.
Large and hazardous items of rubbish such as tires, electrical appliances, electronics, batteries and large industrial containers are sometimes dumped in isolated locations, such as national forests and other public lands.
It is a human impact on the environment and remains a serious environmental issue in many countries.
Litter can exist in the environment for long periods of time before degrading and be transported over large distances into the world's oceans.
Litter can affect the quality of life .
Cigarette butts are the most littered item in the world, with 4.5 trillion discarded annually.
Estimates on the required time for cigarette butts to break down vary, ranging from five years to 400 years for complete degradation.
A decade is a period of 10 years .
The word is derived (via French and Latin) from the Ancient Greek : δεκάς , romanized : dekas , which means a group of ten .
Other words for spans of years also come from Latin: biennium (2 years), triennium (3 years), quadrennium (4 years), lustrum (5 years), century (100 years), millennium (1000 years).

Magazines are generally published serially on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content .
They are generally financed by advertising , by a purchase price , by prepaid subscriptions , or a combination of the three.
At its root, the word magazine refers to a collection or storage location.
It is a collection of written articles, essays, or stories.
These are often accompanied by photographs or other illustrations.
With some magazines the graphic content may be the primary focus instead of literary or news content.
Magazines typically focus on a single topic or subject: art magazines , car magazines , fashion magazines , literary magazines , news magazines , photography magazines, sports magazines , trade magazines , and other areas (see below).
This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines , artillery magazines , firearm magazines , and, in French, retail stores such as department stores .

Marble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals , most commonly calcite or dolomite .
Marble is typically not foliated , although there are exceptions.
In geology , the term marble refers to metamorphosed limestone , but its use in stonemasonry more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone.
Marble is commonly used for sculpture and as a building material.
In vertebrate anatomy , the throat is the front part of the neck , positioned in front of the vertebra .
It contains the pharynx and larynx .
An important section of it is the epiglottis , which is a flap separating the esophagus from the trachea (windpipe) preventing food and drink being inhaled into the lungs.
The throat contains various blood vessels , pharyngeal muscles, the nasopharyngeal tonsil , the tonsils, the palatine uvula, the trachea, the esophagus , and the vocal cords.
Mammal throats consist of two bones, the hyoid bone and the clavicle .
The throat is sometimes thought to be synonymous for the fauces .
It works with the mouth, ears and nose, as well as a number of other parts of the body.
Its pharynx is connected to the mouth, allowing speech to occur, and food and liquid to pass down the throat.
It is joined to the nose by the nasopharynx at the top of the throat, and to ear by its Eustachian tube .
The throat's trachea carries inhaled air to the bronchi of the lungs.
The esophagus carries food through the throat to the stomach.
Adenoids and tonsils help prevent infection and are composed of lymph tissue.
The larynx contains vocal cords, the epiglottis (preventing food/liquid inhalation), and an area known as the subglottic larynx—the narrowest section of the upper part of the throat.
In the larynx, the vocal cords consist of two membranes that act according to the pressure of the air.
Cardboard is a generic term for heavy-duty paper-based products having greater thickness and superior durability or other specific mechanical attributes to paper; such as foldability, rigidity and impact resistance.
The construction can range from a thick sheet known as paperboard to corrugated fiberboard which is made of multiple corrugated and flat layers.
Despite widespread general use in English and French, the term cardboard is deprecated in commerce and industry as not adequately defining a specific product.
Material producers, container manufacturers, packaging engineers , and standards organizations , use more specific terminology.
The points of the compass mark the divisions on a compass , which is primarily divided into the four cardinal directions : north , south , east , and west .
These points are further subdivided by the addition of the four intercardinal (or ordinal) directions—northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW)—to indicate the eight principal winds.
In meteorological usage, further intermediate points between the cardinal and intercardinal directions, such as north-northeast (NNE) are added to give the sixteen points of a compass rose .
At the most complete division are the full thirty-two points of the mariner's compass , which adds points such as north by east (NbE; sometimes NxE) between north and north-northeast, and northeast by north (NEbN; NExN) between north-northeast and northeast.
A compass point allows reference to a specific course (or azimuth ) in a colloquial fashion, without having to compute or remember degrees.
The European nautical tradition retained the term one point to describe ​ ⁄ 32 of a circle in such phrases as two points to starboard.
By the middle of the 18th century, the 32-point system was extended with half- and quarter-points to allow 128 directions to be differentiated.
Alabama ( ) is a state in the southeastern region of the United States .
It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west.
Alabama is the 30th largest by area and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states .
With a total of 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of inland waterways , Alabama has among the most of any state.
Alabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State , after the state bird .
Alabama is also known as the Heart of Dixie and the Cotton State.
The state tree is the longleaf pine , and the state flower is the camellia .
Alabama's capital is Montgomery .
The largest city by population is Birmingham , which has long been the most industrialized city; the largest city by land area is Huntsville .
The oldest city is Mobile , founded by French colonists in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana .
From the American Civil War until World War II , Alabama, like many states in the southern U.S. , suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture.
Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed Jim Crow laws to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against African Americans from the end of the Reconstruction Era up until at least the 1970s.
Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, white rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s.
During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented.
Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests.
The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.
Technophobia (from Greek τέχνη technē , art, skill, craft and φόβος phobos , fear ) is the fear or dislike of advanced technology or complex devices, especially computers .
Although there are numerous interpretations of technophobia, they become more complex as technology continues to evolve.
The term is generally used in the sense of an irrational fear, but others contend fears are justified.
It is the opposite of technophilia .
Larry Rosen, a research psychologist , computer educator, and professor at California State University , suggests that there are three dominant subcategories of technophobes - the uncomfortable users, the cognitive computerphobes, and anxious computerphobes.
First receiving widespread notice during the Industrial Revolution , technophobia has been observed to affect various societies and communities throughout the world.
This has caused some groups to take stances against some modern technological developments in order to preserve their ideologies.
In some of these cases, the new technologies conflict with established beliefs, such as the personal values of simplicity and modest lifestyles.
Examples of technophobic ideas can be found in multiple forms of art, ranging from literary works such as Frankenstein to films like Metropolis .
Many of these works portray a darker side to technology, as perceived by those who are technophobic.
As technologies become increasingly complex and difficult to understand, people are more likely to harbor anxieties relating to their use of modern technologies.
Film , also called movie or motion picture , is a medium used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with other sensory stimulations.
The word cinema , short for cinematography , is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry , and to the art form that is the result of it.
The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera , by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation , or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects .
Traditionally, films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen .
Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack (a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected).
Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures .
They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them.
Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating —or indoctrinating —citizens.
The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication.
Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages.
The individual images that make up a film are called frames .
In the projection of traditional celluloid films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame, in turn, is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision , whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears.
The perception of motion is partly due to a psychological effect called the phi phenomenon .
The name film originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock ) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures.
Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including picture , picture show , moving picture , photoplay , and flick .
The most common term in the United States is movie , while in Europe film is preferred.
Common terms for the field in general include the big screen , the silver screen , the movies , and cinema ; the last of these is commonly used, as an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays.
In early years, the word sheet was sometimes used instead of screen .
A landscape is the visible features of an area of land , its landforms , and how they integrate with natural or man-made features.
A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined landforms such as (ice-capped) mountains , hills , water bodies such as rivers , lakes , ponds and the sea , living elements of land cover including indigenous vegetation , human elements including different forms of land use , buildings, and structures , and transitory elements such as lighting and weather conditions.
Combining both their physical origins and the cultural overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and national identity .
The character of a landscape helps define the self-image of the people who inhabit it and a sense of place that differentiates one region from other regions.
It is the dynamic backdrop to people's lives.
Landscape can be as varied as farmland, a landscape park or wilderness .
The Earth has a vast range of landscapes, including the icy landscapes of polar regions , mountainous landscapes, vast arid desert landscapes, islands , and coastal landscapes, densely forested or wooded landscapes including past boreal forests and tropical rainforests , and agricultural landscapes of temperate and tropical regions.
The activity of modifying the visible features of an area of land is referred to as landscaping .
Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea .
Beer is brewed from cereal grains —most commonly from malted barley , though wheat , maize (corn), and rice are also used.
During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer.
Most modern beer is brewed with hops , which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent.
Other flavouring agents such as gruit , herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops.
In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.
Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and The Hymn to Ninkasi , a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.
Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on draught , particularly in pubs and bars.
The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries .
The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (ABV), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% ABV and above.
Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals , as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games .
An antibiotic is a type of antimicrobial substance active against bacteria and is the most important type of antibacterial agent for fighting bacterial infections .
Antibiotic medications are widely used in the treatment and prevention of such infections.
They may either kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria .
A limited number of antibiotics also possess antiprotozoal activity.
Antibiotics are not effective against viruses such as the common cold or influenza ; drugs which inhibit viruses are termed antiviral drugs or antivirals rather than antibiotics.
Sometimes, the term antibiotic which means opposing life, based on Greek roots, (ἀντι-) anti: against and (βίος-) biotic: life, is broadly used to refer to any substance used against microbes , but in the usual medical usage, antibiotics (such as penicillin ) are those produced naturally (by one microorganism fighting another), whereas nonantibiotic antibacterials (such as sulfonamides and antiseptics ) are fully synthetic .
However, both classes have the same goal of killing or preventing the growth of microorganisms, and both are included in antimicrobial chemotherapy .
Antibacterials include antiseptic drugs, antibacterial soaps , and chemical disinfectants , whereas antibiotics are an important class of antibacterials used more specifically in medicine and sometimes in livestock feed .
Antibiotics have been used since ancient times.
Many civilizations used topical application of mouldy bread, with many references to its beneficial effects arising from ancient Egypt, China, Serbia, Greece and Rome.
The first person to directly document the use of moulds to treat infections was John Parkinson (1567–1650).
Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century.
Alexander Fleming (1881–1955) discovered modern day penicillin in 1928.
After realizing the great potential there was in penicillin, Fleming pursued the challenge of how to market it and translate it to commercial use.
With help from other biochemists, penicillin was finally available for widespread use.
This was significantly beneficial during wartime.
Unfortunately, it didn't take long for resistance to begin.
Effectiveness and easy access have also led to their overuse and some bacteria have developed resistance .
This has led to widespread problems, and the World Health Organization has classified antimicrobial resistance as a serious threat that is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country.

Rhetoric is the art of persuasion.
Along with grammar and logic (or dialectic – see Martianus Capella ), it is one of the three ancient arts of discourse .
Rhetoric aims to study the capacities of writers or speakers needed to inform, persuade, or motivate particular audiences in specific situations.
Aristotle defines rhetoric as the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion and since mastery of the art was necessary for victory in a case at law or for passage of proposals in the assembly or for fame as a speaker in civic ceremonies, calls it a combination of the science of logic and of the ethical branch of politics.
Rhetoric typically provides heuristics for understanding, discovering, and developing arguments for particular situations, such as Aristotle's three persuasive audience appeals: logos , pathos , and ethos .
The five canons of rhetoric or phases of developing a persuasive speech were first codified in classical Rome: invention , arrangement , style , memory , and delivery .
From Ancient Greece to the late 19th century, rhetoric played a central role in Western education in training orators, lawyers, counsellors, historians, statesmen, and poets.
A building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a house or factory .
Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, and aesthetic reasons.
To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures .
Buildings serve several societal needs – primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work.
A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat (a place of comfort and safety) and the outside (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).
Ever since the first cave paintings , buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression.
In recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings.
Plastic is material consisting of any of a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic organic compounds that are malleable and so can be molded into solid objects.
Plasticity is the general property of all materials which can deform irreversibly without breaking but, in the class of moldable polymers , this occurs to such a degree that their actual name derives from this specific ability.
Plastics are typically organic polymers of high molecular mass and often contain other substances.
They are usually synthetic, most commonly derived from petrochemicals , however, an array of variants are made from renewable materials such as polylactic acid from corn or cellulosics from cotton linters.
Due to their low cost, ease of manufacture, versatility, and imperviousness to water, plastics are used in a multitude of products of different scale, including paper clips and spacecraft.
They have prevailed over traditional materials, such as wood , stone , horn and bone , leather , metal , glass , and ceramic , in some products previously left to natural materials.
In developed economies, about a third of plastic is used in packaging and roughly the same in buildings in applications such as piping , plumbing or vinyl siding .
Other uses include automobiles (up to 20% plastic ), furniture, and toys.
In the developing world, the applications of plastic may differ—42% of India's consumption is used in packaging.
Plastics have many uses in the medical field as well, with the introduction of polymer implants and other medical devices derived at least partially from plastic.
The field of plastic surgery is not named for use of plastic materials, but rather the meaning of the word plasticity, with regard to the reshaping of flesh.
The world's first fully synthetic plastic was bakelite , invented in New York in 1907 by Leo Baekeland who coined the term 'plastics'.
Many chemists have contributed to the materials science of plastics, including Nobel laureate Hermann Staudinger who has been called the father of polymer chemistry and Herman Mark , known as the father of polymer physics .
The success and dominance of plastics starting in the early 20th century led to environmental concerns regarding its slow decomposition rate after being discarded as trash due to its composition of large molecules.
Toward the end of the century, one approach to this problem was met with wide efforts toward recycling .
Sensation refers to the processing of senses by the sensory system ; see also sensation (psychology) .
Sensation or sensations may also refer to:
A mosque ( ; from Arabic : مَسْجِد ‎, romanized : masjid , pronounced masdʒid ; literally place of ritual prostration) is a place of worship for Muslims .
Any act of worship that follows the Islamic rules of prayer can be said to create a mosque, whether or not it takes place in a special building.
Informal and open-air places of worship are called musalla , while mosques used for communal prayer on Fridays are known as jāmiʿ .
Mosque buildings typically contain an ornamental niche ( mihrab ) set into the wall that indicates the direction of Mecca ( qiblah ), ablution facilities and minarets from which calls to prayer are issued.
The pulpit ( minbar ), from which the Friday sermon ( khutba ) is delivered, was in earlier times characteristic of the central city mosque, but has since become common in smaller mosques.
Mosques typically have segregated spaces for men and women.
This basic pattern of organization has assumed different forms depending on the region, period and denomination.
Mosques commonly serve as locations for prayer, Ramadan vigils, funeral services, Sufi ceremonies, marriage and business agreements, alms collection and distribution, as well as homeless shelters.
Historically, mosques were also important centers of elementary education and advanced training in religious sciences .
In modern times, they have preserved their role as places of religious instruction and debate, but higher learning now generally takes place in specialized institutions.
Special importance is accorded to the Great Mosque of Mecca (center of the hajj ), the Prophet's Mosque in Medina (burial place of Muhammad ) and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem (believed to be the site of Muhammad's ascent to heaven ).
In the past, many mosques in the Muslim world were built over burial places of Sufi saints and other venerated figures, which has turned them into popular pilgrimage destinations.
With the spread of Islam , mosques multiplied across the Islamic world.
Sometimes churches and other temples were converted into mosques, which influenced Islamic architectural styles .
While most pre-modern mosques were funded by charitable endowments , modern states in the Muslim world have attempted to bring mosques under government control.
Increasing government regulation of large mosques has been countered by a rise of privately funded mosques of various affiliations and ideologies, many of which serve as bases for different Islamic revivalist currents and social activism.
Mosques have played a number of political roles.
The rates of mosque attendance vary widely depending on the region.
The lion ( Panthera leo ) is one of the largest species in the family Felidae ; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
The lion is sexually dimorphic ; males are larger than females with a typical weight range of 150 to 250 kg (330 to 550 lb) for males and 120 to 182 kg (265 to 400 lb) for females.
Male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species.
Lions are social , forming groups called prides .
A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs.
Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates .
The species is an apex and keystone predator , although they scavenge when opportunities occur.
Some lions have been known to hunt humans, although the species typically does not.
Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas but is absent in dense forests .
It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight .
In the Pleistocene , the lion ranged throughout Eurasia, Africa and North America but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in Sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered population in western India.
It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s.
Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas.
Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature.
Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century.
Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in the Upper Paleolithic period; carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France have been dated to 17,000 years ago, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures that coincided with the lion's former and current ranges.

Cologne ( English: ; German : Köln , pronounced kœln ( listen ) , Ripuarian : Kölle ˈkœlə ( listen ) ) is the largest city of Germany's most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the fourth most populous city in Germany after Berlin , Hamburg , and Munich .
With slightly over a million inhabitants (1.08 million) within its city boundaries , Cologne is the largest city on the Rhine and also the most populous city both of the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region , which is Germany's largest and one of Europe's major metropolitan areas , and of the Rhineland .
Centered on the left bank of the Rhine, Cologne is about 45 kilometres (28 mi) southeast of North Rhine-Westphalia's capital of Düsseldorf and 25 kilometres (16 mi) northwest of Bonn .
It is the largest city in the Central Franconian and Ripuarian dialect areas.
The city's famous Cologne Cathedral ( Kölner Dom ) is the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of Cologne .
There are many institutions of higher education in the city, most notably the University of Cologne ( Universität zu Köln ), one of Europe's oldest and largest universities, the Technical University of Cologne ( Technische Hochschule Köln ), Germany's largest university of applied sciences, and the German Sport University Cologne ( Deutsche Sporthochschule Köln ), Germany's only sport university.
Cologne Bonn Airport ( Flughafen Köln/Bonn ) is Germany's seventh-largest airport and lies in the southeast of the city.
The main airport for the Rhine-Ruhr region is Düsseldorf Airport .
Cologne was founded and established in Ubii territory in the 1st century AD as the Roman Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium , the first word of which is the origin of its name.
An alternative Latin name of the settlement is Augusta Ubiorum , after the Ubii.
Cologne, the French version of the city's name, has become standard in English as well.
Cologne functioned as the capital of the Roman province of Germania Inferior and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the Franks in 462.
During the Middle Ages the city flourished as being located on one of the most important major trade routes between east and west in Europe.
Cologne was one of the leading members of the Hanseatic League and one of the largest cities north of the Alps in medieval and Renaissance times.
Prior to World War II the city had undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918–1926).
Cologne was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II, with the Royal Air Force (RAF) dropping 34,711 long tons (35,268 tonnes) of bombs on the city .
The bombing reduced the population by 95%, mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city.
With the intention of restoring as many historic buildings as possible, the successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape.
Cologne is a major cultural centre for the Rhineland ; it hosts more than 30 museums and hundreds of galleries.
Exhibitions range from local ancient Roman archeological sites to contemporary graphics and sculpture.
The Cologne Trade Fair hosts a number of trade shows such as Art Cologne , imm Cologne , Gamescom , and the Photokina .
Plants are mainly multicellular , predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae .
Historically, plants were treated as one of two kingdoms including all living things that were not animals , and all algae and fungi were treated as plants.
However, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria ).
By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for green plants), a group that includes the flowering plants , conifers and other gymnosperms , ferns and their allies , hornworts , liverworts , mosses and the green algae , but excludes the red and brown algae .
Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria .
Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color.
Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize.
Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations , although asexual reproduction is also common.
There are about 320 thousand species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260–290 thousand, are seed plants (see the table below ).
Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems, especially on land.
Plants that produce grain , fruit and vegetables form humankind's basic foods, and have been domesticated for millennia.
Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials , writing material and, in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs .
The scientific study of plants is known as botany , a branch of biology .
The workforce or labour force is the labour pool in employment .
It is generally used to describe those working for a single company or industry , but can also apply to a geographic region like a city, state, or country.
Within a company, its value can be labelled as its Workforce in Place.
The workforce of a country includes both the employed and the unemployed.
The labour force participation rate , LFPR (or economic activity rate , EAR ), is the ratio between the labour force and the overall size of their cohort (national population of the same age range).
The term generally excludes the employers or management , and can imply those involved in manual labour .
It may also mean all those who are available for work.
The heel is the prominence at the posterior end of the foot .
It is based on the projection of one bone, the calcaneus or heel bone, behind the articulation of the bones of the lower leg .
Kabul ( Persian : کابل ‎, romanized : Kābol , Pashto : کابل ‎, romanized: Kābəl ) is the capital and largest city of Afghanistan , located in the eastern section of the country.
It is also a municipality , forming part of the greater Kabul Province .
According to estimates in 2019, the population of Kabul is 5.266 million, which includes all the major ethnic groups of Afghanistan.
Rapid urbanization had made Kabul the world's 75th largest city .
Kabul is located high up in a narrow valley between the Hindu Kush mountains, with an elevation of 1,790 metres (5,873 ft) making it one of the highest capitals in the world .
The city is said to be over 3,500 years old, mentioned since at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire .
It is at a strategic location along the trade routes of South and Central Asia , and a key location of the ancient Silk Road .
It has been part of the Achaemenids followed by the Seleucids , Greco Bactrians , Indo Greeks , Kushans , Kabul Shahis , Saffarids , Samanids , Ghaznavids , Ghurids , Khwarazmians , Qarlughids , Khaljis , Timurids , Mughals , and Hotaks , until finally becoming part of the Durrani Empire (also known as the Afghan Empire) in 1747.
Kabul became the capital of Afghan Empire in 1776, during the reign of Timur Shah Durrani , the son of Ahmad Farehd Alizadeh.
In the early 19th century, the British occupied the city but after establishing foreign relations they were compelled to withdraw all forces from Afghanistan.
The city was occupied by the Soviets in 1979 but they too abandoned it after the 1988 Geneva Accords were signed.
A civil war in the 1990s between various rebel groups destroyed much of the city, resulting in many casualties.
Kabul is known for its gardens, bazaars , and palaces .
It was also formerly a mecca for young western hippies .
Since the removal of the Taliban from power in late 2001, the city began rebuilding itself with assistance from the international community.
Despite the many terrorist attacks by anti-state elements, the city is developing and was the fifth fastest-growing city in the world as of 2012.
The city is divided into 22 districts .
Traffic on roads consists of road users including pedestrians, ridden or herded animals, vehicles, streetcars , buses and other conveyances , either singly or together, while using the public way for purposes of travel.
Traffic laws are the laws which govern traffic and regulate vehicles, while rules of the road are both the laws and the informal rules that may have developed over time to facilitate the orderly and timely flow of traffic.
Organized traffic generally has well-established priorities, lanes, right-of-way , and traffic control at intersections .
Traffic is formally organized in many jurisdictions, with marked lanes , junctions , intersections , interchanges , traffic signals , or signs .
Traffic is often classified by type: heavy motor vehicle (e.g., car, truck), other vehicle (e.g., moped , bicycle), and pedestrian.
Different classes may share speed limits and easement, or may be segregated.
Some jurisdictions may have very detailed and complex rules of the road while others rely more on drivers' common sense and willingness to cooperate.
Organization typically produces a better combination of travel safety and efficiency.
Events which disrupt the flow and may cause traffic to degenerate into a disorganized mess include road construction , collisions , and debris in the roadway .
On particularly busy freeways, a minor disruption may persist in a phenomenon known as traffic waves .
A complete breakdown of organization may result in traffic congestion and gridlock .
Simulations of organized traffic frequently involve queuing theory , stochastic processes and equations of mathematical physics applied to traffic flow .
The horse ( Equus ferus caballus ) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus .
It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae .
The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus , into the large, single-toed animal of today.
Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC.
Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses .
These feral populations are not true wild horses , as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse , a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse .
There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors , markings , breeds , locomotion , and behavior.
Horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response .
Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults.
Female horses, called mares , carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal , can stand and run shortly following birth.
Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four.
They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.
Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited hot bloods with speed and endurance; cold bloods, such as draft horses and some ponies , suitable for slow, heavy work; and warmbloods , developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe.
There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.
Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as police work , agriculture , entertainment, and therapy .
Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control.
Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares.
Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers .
A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure.
As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid , gas , and plasma ), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape.
A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds .
Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container.
Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed.
Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density.
A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension , leading to wetting phenomena.
Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth.
The density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher than in a gas.
Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter .
On the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids .
Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist.
Most known matter in the universe is in gaseous form (with traces of detectable solid matter) as interstellar clouds or in plasma from within stars.
The Taliban ( Pashto : طالبان ‎, ṭālibān students) or Taleban , who refer to themselves as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan ( IEA ), are a Sunni Islamic fundamentalist political movement and military organization in Afghanistan currently waging war (an insurgency , or jihad ) within that country.
Since 2016, the Taliban's leader is Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada .
From 1996 to 2001, the Taliban held power over roughly three quarters of Afghanistan , and enforced there a strict interpretation of Sharia , or Islamic law.
The Taliban emerged in 1994 as one of the prominent factions in the Afghan Civil War and largely consisted of students ( talib ) from the Pashtun areas of eastern and southern Afghanistan who had been educated in traditional Islamic schools , and fought during the Soviet–Afghan War .
Under the leadership of Mohammed Omar , the movement spread throughout most of Afghanistan, sequestering power from the Mujahideen warlords.
The totalitarian Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was established in 1996 and the Afghan capital was transferred to Kandahar .
It held control of most of the country until being overthrown after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in December 2001 following the September 11 attacks .
At its peak, formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban's government was acknowledged by only three nations: Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates .
The group later regrouped as an insurgency movement to fight the American-backed Karzai administration and the NATO -led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in the War in Afghanistan .
The Taliban have been condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law, which has resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans, especially women .
During their rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians, denied UN food supplies to 160,000 starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth , burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes.
According to the United Nations , the Taliban and their allies were responsible for 76% of Afghan civilian casualties in 2010, 80% in 2011, and 80% in 2012.
Taliban has also engaged in cultural genocide , destroying numerous monuments including the famous 1500-year old Buddhas of Bamiyan .
The Taliban's ideology has been described as combining an innovative form of sharia Islamic law based on Deobandi fundamentalism and the militant Islamism and Salafi jihadism of Osama bin Laden with Pashtun social and cultural norms known as Pashtunwali , as most Taliban are Pashtun tribesmen.
The Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence and military are widely alleged by the international community and the Afghan government to have provided support to the Taliban during their founding and time in power, and of continuing to support the Taliban during the insurgency.
Pakistan states that it dropped all support for the group after the September 11 attacks .
In 2001, reportedly 2,500 Arabs under command of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden fought for the Taliban.
An accident , also known as an unintentional act , is an undesirable, incidental, and an unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized, and acted upon, prior to its occurrence.
Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term accident and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity.
Johnson is a surname of English , Scottish origin.
The name itself is a patronym of the given name John , literally meaning son of John.
The name John derives from Latin Johannes , which is derived through Greek Ἰωάννης Iōannēs from Hebrew יוחנן Yohanan , meaning Yahweh has favoured.
The name has been extremely popular in Europe since the Christian era as a result of it being given to St John the Baptist , St John the Evangelist and nearly one thousand other Christian saints .
Johnson is the second most common in the United States and 154th most common in the world.
As a Scottish family name, Johnson is occasionally a variation of Johnston , a habitational name.
A blackboard (also known as a chalkboard ) is a reusable writing surface on which text or drawings are made with sticks of calcium sulfate or calcium carbonate , known, when used for this purpose, as chalk .
Blackboards were originally made of smooth, thin sheets of black or dark grey slate stone.
Progress is the movement towards a refined, improved, or otherwise desired state or, in the context of progressivism , the idea that advancements in technology , science , and social organization can result in an improved human condition ; the latter may happen as a result of direct human action, as in social enterprise or through activism , or as a natural part of sociocultural evolution .
The concept of progress was introduced in the early 19th-century social theories , especially social evolution as described by Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer .
It was present in the Enlightenment 's philosophies of history .
As a goal, social progress has been advocated by varying realms of political ideologies with different theories on how it is to be achieved.
In physiology, dehydration is a deficit of total body water , with an accompanying disruption of metabolic processes .
It occurs when free water loss exceeds free water intake, usually due to exercise, disease, or high environmental temperature.
Mild dehydration can also be caused by immersion diuresis , which may increase risk of decompression sickness in divers .
Most people can tolerate a three to four percent decrease in total body water without difficulty or adverse health effects.
A five to eight percent decrease can cause fatigue and dizziness .
Loss of over ten percent of total body water can cause physical and mental deterioration, accompanied by severe thirst .
Death occurs at a loss of between fifteen and twenty-five percent of the body water.
Mild dehydration is characterized by thirst and general discomfort and is usually resolved with oral rehydration .
Dehydration can cause hypernatremia (high levels of sodium ions in the blood) and is distinct from hypovolemia (loss of blood volume , particularly blood plasma ).
Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin : aurum ) and atomic number 79, making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally.
In its purest form, it is a bright , slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable , and ductile metal .
Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element .
It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions .
Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks , in veins , and in alluvial deposits .
It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum ) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium .
Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium ( gold tellurides ).
Gold is resistant to most acids , though it does dissolve in aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid , which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion .
Gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects, giving rise to the term acid test .
Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide , which are used in mining and electroplating .
Gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys, but this is not a chemical reaction .
A relatively rare element, gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage , jewelry , and other arts throughout recorded history .
In the past, a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy , but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s, and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after 1971 .
A total of 186,700 tonnes of gold exists above ground, as of 2015 .
The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments , and 10% in industry .
Gold's high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use).
Gold is also used in infrared shielding, colored-glass production, gold leafing , and tooth restoration .
Certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine.
As of 2017 , the world's largest gold producer by far was China with 440 tonnes per year.

In human anatomy , the arm is the part of the upper limb between the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and the elbow joint .
In common usage, the arm extends to the hand.
It can be divided into the upper arm, which extends from the shoulder to the elbow, the forearm which extends from the elbow to the hand, and the hand .
Anatomically the shoulder girdle with bones and corresponding muscles is by definition a part of the arm.
The Latin term brachium may refer to either the arm as a whole or to the upper arm on its own.
A missionary is a member of a religious group sent into an area to promote their faith or perform ministries of service, such as education , literacy , social justice , health care , and economic development .
The word mission originates from 1598 when the Jesuits sent members abroad, derived from the Latin missionem (nom.
missio ), meaning act of sending or mittere , meaning to send.
The word was used in light of its biblical usage; in the Latin translation of the Bible , Christ uses the word when sending the disciples to preach The gospel in his name.
The term is most commonly used for Christian missions, but can be used for any creed or ideology.
A slogan is a memorable motto or phrase used in a clan , political , commercial , religious , and other context as a repetitive expression of an idea or purpose, with the goal of persuading members of the public or a more defined target group.
The Oxford Dictionary of English defines a slogan as a short and striking or memorable phrase used in advertising.
A slogan usually has the attributes of being memorable, very concise and appealing to the audience.

Beautiful , an adjective used to describe things as possessing beauty , may refer to:
A fin is a thin component or appendage attached to a larger body or structure.
Fins typically function as foils that produce lift or thrust , or provide the ability to steer or stabilize motion while traveling in water, air, or other fluids .
Fins are also used to increase surface areas for heat transfer purposes , or simply as ornamentation.
Fins first evolved on fish as a means of locomotion.
Fish fins are used to generate thrust and control the subsequent motion.
Fish, and other aquatic animals such as cetaceans , actively propel and steer themselves with pectoral and tail fins .
As they swim, they use other fins, such as dorsal and anal fins , to achieve stability and refine their maneuvering.
Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought .
This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter .
Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity .
Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness.
Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime, and thus believe that the person charged should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation .
In most countries, a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence, possibly a life sentence ; and in a few, the death penalty may be imposed.
International is an adjective (also used as a noun) meaning between nations.

A pillow is a support of the body at rest for comfort, therapy, or decoration.
Pillows are used by many species, including humans.
Some types of pillows include throw pillows and decorative pillows.
Pillows that aid sleeping are a form of bedding that supports the head and neck.
Other types of pillows are designed to support the body when lying down or sitting.
There are also pillows that consider human body shape for increased comfort during sleep.
Decorative pillows used on beds, couches or chairs are sometimes referred to as cushions .
In contemporary western culture, pillows consist of a plain or patterned fabric envelope (known as a pillowcase) which contains a soft stuffing, typically synthetic and typically standardized in sizes and shape.
Pillows have been historically made of a variety of natural materials and many cultures continue to use pillows made from natural materials.
The word pillow comes from Middle English pilwe , from Old English pyle (akin to Old High German pfuliwi ) and from Latin pulvinus .
The first known use of the word pillow was before the 12th century.
Canals , or navigations , are human-made channels , or artificial waterways , for water conveyance, or to service water transport vehicles .
It can be thought as an artificial version of a river .
In most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create reservoirs of low speed current flow.
These reservoirs are referred to as slack water levels , often just called levels .
A canal is also known as a navigation when it parallels a river and shares part of its waters and drainage basin, and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its stretches of slack water levels while staying in its valley .
In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge , generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation .
Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and other water ways crossing far below.
Canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination such as a city where water is needed.
The Roman Empire 's aqueducts were such water supply canals.
Thanasis (Θανάσης) is a Greek given name, short for Athanasios (Αθανάσιος), which can mean eternal life or immortal.
Notable people with the name Thanasis or Thanassis include:

Zambia ( ), officially the Republic of Zambia , is a landlocked country in south - central Africa (although some sources consider it part of East Africa ).
Its neighbors are the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Tanzania to the north-east, Malawi to the east, Mozambique to the southeast, Zimbabwe and Botswana to the south, Namibia to the southwest, and Angola to the west.
The capital city is Lusaka , located in the south-central part of Zambia.
The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the Copperbelt Province to the northwest, the core economic hubs of the country.
Originally inhabited by Khoisan peoples, the region was affected by the Bantu expansion of the thirteenth century.
Following European explorers in the eighteenth century, the British colonised the region into the British protectorates of Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia towards the end of the nineteenth century.
These were merged in 1911 to form Northern Rhodesia .
For most of the colonial period, Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the British South Africa Company .
On 24 October 1964, Zambia became independent of the United Kingdom and prime minister Kenneth Kaunda became the inaugural president.
Kaunda's socialist United National Independence Party (UNIP) maintained power from 1964 until 1991.
Kaunda played a key role in regional diplomacy, cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Angola, and Namibia.
From 1972 to 1991 Zambia was a one-party state with the UNIP as the sole legal political party under the motto One Zambia, One Nation.
Kaunda was succeeded by Frederick Chiluba of the social-democratic Movement for Multi-Party Democracy in 1991, beginning a period of social-economic growth and government decentralisation.
Levy Mwanawasa , Chiluba's chosen successor, presided over Zambia from January 2002 until his death in August 2008, and is credited with campaigns to reduce corruption and increase the standard of living.
After Mwanawasa's death, Rupiah Banda presided as Acting President before being elected President in 2008.
Holding office for only three years, Banda stepped down after his defeat in the 2011 elections by Patriotic Front party leader Michael Sata .
Sata died on 28 October 2014, making him the second Zambian president to die in office.
Guy Scott served briefly as interim president until new elections were held on 20 January 2015, in which Edgar Lungu was elected as the sixth President .
In 2010, the World Bank named Zambia one of the world's fastest economically reformed countries.
The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) is headquartered in Lusaka.
Bump or Bumps may refer to:
Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale using labour and machines , tools , chemical and biological processing, or formulation.
The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech , but is most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.
Such finished goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other, more complex products, such as aircraft , household appliances , furniture , sports equipment or automobiles , or sold to wholesalers , who in turn sell them to retailers , who then sell them to end users and consumers .
Manufacturing engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product.
The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification from which the product is made.
These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part.
Modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required in the production and integration of a product's components.
Some industries, such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead.
The manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial design .
Examples of major manufacturers in North America include General Motors Corporation , General Electric , Procter & Gamble , General Dynamics , Boeing , Pfizer , and Precision Castparts .
Examples in Europe include Volkswagen Group , Siemens , FCA and Michelin .
Examples in Asia include Toyota , Yamaha , Panasonic , LG , Samsung and Tata Motors .
An ambassador is an official envoy, especially a high-ranking diplomat who represents a state and is usually accredited to another sovereign state or to an international organization as the resident representative of their own government or sovereign or appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment.
The word is also often used more liberally for persons who are known, without national appointment, to represent certain professions, activities and fields of endeavor such as sales.
An ambassador is the ranking government representative stationed in a foreign capital.
The host country typically allows the ambassador control of specific territory called an embassy , whose territory, staff, and vehicles are generally afforded diplomatic immunity in the host country.
Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations , an ambassador has the highest diplomatic rank .
Countries may choose to maintain diplomatic relations at a lower level by appointing a chargé d'affaires in place of an ambassador.
The equivalent to an ambassador exchanged among members of the Commonwealth of Nations are known as High Commissioners .
The ambassadors of the Holy See are known as Papal or Apostolic Nuncios .
An interview is a conversation where questions are asked and answers are given.
In common parlance, the word interview refers to a one-on-one conversation between an interviewer and an interviewee .
The interviewer asks questions to which the interviewee responds, usually so information may be transferred from interviewee to interviewer (and any other audience of the interview).
Sometimes, information can be transferred in both directions.
It is a communication, unlike a speech, which produces a one-way flow of information.
Interviews usually take place face-to-face and in person, although modern communications technologies such as the Internet have enabled conversations to happen in which parties are separated geographically, such as with videoconferencing software, and telephone interviews can happen without visual contact.
Interviews almost always involve spoken conversation between two or more parties, although in some instances a conversation can happen between two persons who type questions and answers back and forth.
Interviews can range from Unstructured interview or free-wheeling and open-ended conversations in which there is no predetermined plan with prearranged questions, to highly structured conversations in which specific questions occur in a specified order.
They can follow diverse formats; for example, in a ladder interview , a respondent's answers typically guide subsequent interviews, with the object being to explore a respondent's subconscious motives .
Typically the interviewer has some way of recording the information that is gleaned from the interviewee, often by writing with a pencil and paper, sometimes transcribing with a video or audio recorder, depending on the context and extent of information and the length of the interview.
Interviews have a duration in time, in the sense that the interview has a beginning and an ending.
The traditional two-person interview format, sometimes called a one-on-one interview, permits direct questions and followups, which enables an interviewer to better gauge the accuracy of responses.
It is a flexible arrangement in the sense that subsequent questions can be tailored to clarify earlier answers.
Further, it eliminates any possible distortion by having third parties present.
Face to face interviewing makes it easier for people to interact and form a connection, and it helps both the potential employer and potential hire who they might be interacting with.
Further, face to face interview sessions can be more enjoyable.
Helianthus or sunflower ( ) is a genus of plants comprising about 70 species.
Except for three species in South America , all Helianthus species are native to North America and Central America .
The common name, sunflower, typically refers to the popular annual species Helianthus annuus , or the common sunflower, whose round flower heads in combination with the ligules look like the sun.
This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke ( H.
tuberosus ), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants.
The species H.
annuus typically grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.
Perennial sunflower species are not as common in garden use due to their tendency to spread rapidly and become invasive.
The whorled sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus , was listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the Endangered Species Act .
The primary threats are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee.
They grow to 1.8 m (6 ft) and are primarily found in woodlands, adjacent to creeks and moist, prairie-like areas.

Myth is a folklore genre consisting of narratives or stories that play a fundamental role in a society, such as foundational tales or origin myths .
The main characters in myths are usually gods , demigods or supernatural humans.
Stories of everyday human beings, although often of leaders of some type, are usually contained in legends , as opposed to myths.
Myths are often endorsed by rulers and priests or priestesses, and are closely linked to religion or spirituality.
In fact, many societies group their myths, legends and history together, considering myths and legends to be true accounts of their remote past.
In particular, creation myths take place in a primordial age when the world had not achieved its later form.
Other myths explain how a society's customs , institutions and taboos were established and sanctified.
There is a complex relationship between recital of myths and enactment of rituals .
The study of myth began in ancient history .
Rival classes of the Greek myths by Euhemerus , Plato and Sallustius were developed by the Neoplatonists and later revived by Renaissance mythographers.
Today, the study of myth continues in a wide variety of academic fields, including folklore studies , philology , psychology , and anthropology.
The term mythology may either refer to the study of myths in general, or a body of myths regarding a particular subject.
The academic comparisons of bodies of myth is known as comparative mythology .
Since the term myth is widely used to imply that a story is not objectively true , the identification of a narrative as a myth can be highly political: many adherents of religions view their religion's stories as true and therefore object to the stories being characterised as myths.
Nevertheless, scholars now routinely speak of Christian mythology , Jewish mythology , Islamic mythology , Hindu mythology , and so forth.
Traditionally, Western scholarship, with its Judaeo-Christian heritage, has viewed narratives in the Abrahamic religions as being the province of theology rather than mythology; meanwhile, identifying religious stories of colonised cultures, such as stories in Hinduism , as myths enabled Western scholars to imply that they were of lower truth-value than the stories of Christianity .
Labelling all religious narratives as myths can be thought of as treating different traditions with parity.
A tyrant (from Ancient Greek τύραννος , túrannos ), in the modern English-language usage of the word, is an absolute ruler unrestrained by law, or one who has usurped legitimate sovereignty.
Often portrayed as cruel, tyrants may defend their position by oppressive means.
The original Greek term, however, merely meant an authoritarian sovereign without reference to character, bearing no pejorative connotation during the Archaic and early Classical periods.
However, Plato , the Greek philosopher, clearly saw tyrannos as a negative word, and on account of the decisive influence of philosophy on politics, its negative connotations only increased, continuing into the Hellenistic period .
The philosophers Plato and Aristotle defined a tyrant as a person who rules without law, using extreme and cruel methods against both their own people and others.
The Encyclopédie defined the term as a usurper of sovereign power who makes his subjects the victims of his passions and unjust desires, which he substitutes for laws.
In the late fifth and fourth centuries BC, a new kind of tyrant, one who had the support of the military , arose – specifically in Sicily .
One can apply accusations of tyranny to a variety of types of government:
The definition of tyranny can extend to other oppressive forms of policies.
Income is the consumption and saving opportunity gained by an entity within a specified timeframe, which is generally expressed in monetary terms.
For households and individuals, income is the sum of all the wages, salaries, profits, interest payments, rents, and other forms of earnings received in a given period of time.
(also known as gross income ).
Net income is defined as the gross income minus taxes and other deductions (e.g., mandatory pension contributions), and is usually the basis to calculate how much income tax is owed.
In the field of public economics , the concept may comprise the accumulation of both monetary and non-monetary consumption ability, with the former (monetary) being used as a proxy for total income.
For a firm, gross income can be defined as sum of all revenue minus the cost of goods sold .
Net income nets out expenses: net income equals revenue minus cost of goods sold , expenses , depreciation , interest , and taxes.
Redox (short for reduction–oxidation reaction) (pronunciation: redoks or reedoks ) is a type of chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed.
Redox reactions are characterized by the transfer of electrons between chemical species , most often with one species (the reducing agent) undergoing oxidation (losing electrons) while another species (the oxidizing agent) undergoes reduction (gains electrons).
The chemical species from which the electron is stripped is said to have been oxidized, while the chemical species to which the electron is added is said to have been reduced.
In other words:
For example, during the combustion of wood, electrons are transferred from carbon atoms in the wood to oxygen atoms in the air.
The oxygen atoms undergo reduction, gaining electrons, while the carbon atoms undergo oxidation, losing electrons.
Thus oxygen is the oxidizing agent and carbon the reducing agent in this reaction.
Although oxidation reactions are commonly associated with the formation of oxides from oxygen molecules, oxygen is not necessarily included in such reactions, as other chemical species can serve the same function.
Redox reactions can occur relatively slowly, as in the formation of rust , or much more rapidly, as in the case of burning fuel.
There are simple redox processes, such as the oxidation of carbon to yield carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) or the reduction of carbon by hydrogen to yield methane (CH 4 ), and more complex processes such as the oxidation of glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) in the human body.
The elbow is the visible joint between the upper and lower parts of the arm .
It includes prominent landmarks such as the olecranon , the elbow pit , the lateral and medial epicondyles , and the elbow joint .
The elbow joint is the synovial hinge joint between the humerus in the upper arm and the radius and ulna in the forearm which allows the forearm and hand to be moved towards and away from the body.
Medical Subject Headings defines the elbow specifically for humans and other primates, though the term is frequently used for the anterior joints of other mammals, such as dogs.
The name for the elbow in Latin is cubitus , and so the word cubital is used in some elbow-related terms, as in cubital nodes for example.
The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases , commonly known as air , that surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earth's gravity .
The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface , absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation , warming the surface through heat retention ( greenhouse effect ), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation ).
By volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen , 20.95% oxygen , 0.93% argon , 0.04% carbon dioxide , and small amounts of other gases.
Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor , on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere.
Air composition, temperature, and atmospheric pressure vary with altitude, and air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's troposphere and in artificial atmospheres .
The atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15 × 10 kg, three quarters of which is within about 11 km (6.8 mi; 36,000 ft) of the surface.
The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space .
The Kármán line , at 100 km (62 mi), or 1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space.
Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around 120 km (75 mi).
Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition.
The study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science (aerology).
Early pioneers in the field include Léon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann .
A bullet is a kinetic projectile and the component of firearm ammunition that is expelled from the gun barrel during shooting .
The term is from Middle French and originated as the diminutive of the word boulle ( boullet ), which means small ball.
Bullets are made of a variety of materials such as copper , lead , steel , polymer , rubber and even wax .
They are available either singly as in muzzleloading and cap and ball firearms or as a component of paper cartridges , but much more commonly in the form of metallic cartridges .
Bullets are made in a large number of shapes and constructions depending on the intended applications, including specialized functions such as hunting , target shooting , training and combat .
Though the word bullet is often used incorrectly in colloquial language to refer to a cartridge round, a bullet is not a cartridge but rather a component of one.
A round of ammunition cartridge is a combination package of the bullet (which is the projectile), the case (which holds everything together), the propellant (which provide majority of the energy to launch the projectile) and the primer (which ignites the propellant).
This use of the term bullet when intending to describe a cartridge often leads to confusion when the components of a cartridge are specifically referred to.
Bullet sizes are expressed by their weights and diameters (referred to as calibers ) in both imperial and metric measurement systems.
For example: 55 grain .223 caliber bullets are of the same weight and caliber as 3.56 gram 5.56mm caliber bullets.
The bullets used in many cartridges are fired at muzzle velocities faster than the speed of sound — about 343 metres per second (1,130 ft/s) in dry air at 20 °C (68 °F) — and thus can travel a substantial distance to a target before a nearby observer hears the sound of the shot.
The sound of gunfire (i.e. the muzzle report) is often accompanied with a loud bullwhip -like crack as the supersonic bullet pierces through the air creating a sonic boom .
Bullet speeds at various stages of flight depend on intrinsic factors such as its sectional density , aerodynamic profile and ballistic coefficient , and extrinsic factors such as barometric pressure , humidity , air temperature and wind speed .
Subsonic cartridges fire bullets slower than the speed of sound so there is no sonic boom.
This means that a subsonic cartridge, such as .45 ACP , can be substantially quieter than a supersonic cartridge such as the .223 Remington , even without the use of a suppressor .
Bullets do not normally contain explosives , but damage the intended target by transferring kinetic energy upon impact and penetration (see terminal ballistics ).
A cruiser is a type of warship .
Modern cruisers are generally the largest ships in a fleet after aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships , and can usually perform several roles.
The term has been in use for several hundred years, and has had different meanings throughout this period.
During the Age of Sail , the term cruising referred to certain kinds of missions—independent scouting, commerce protection, or raiding—fulfilled by a frigate or sloop-of-war , which were the cruising warships of a fleet.
In the middle of the 19th century, cruiser came to be a classification for the ships intended for cruising distant waters, commerce raiding, and scouting for the battle fleet.
Cruisers came in a wide variety of sizes, from the medium-sized protected cruiser to large armored cruisers that were nearly as big (although not as powerful or as well-armored) as a pre-dreadnought battleship .
With the advent of the dreadnought battleship before World War I , the armored cruiser evolved into a vessel of similar scale known as the battlecruiser .
The very large battlecruisers of the World War I era that succeeded armored cruisers were now classified, along with dreadnought battleships, as capital ships .
By the early 20th century after World War I, the direct successors to protected cruisers could be placed on a consistent scale of warship size, smaller than a battleship but larger than a destroyer .
In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty placed a formal limit on these cruisers, which were defined as warships of up to 10,000 tons displacement carrying guns no larger than 8 inches in calibre; heavy cruisers had 8-inch guns, while those with guns of 6.1 inches or less were light cruisers , which shaped cruiser design until the end of World War II.
Some variations on the Treaty cruiser design included the German Deutschland -class pocket battleships which had heavier armament at the expense of speed compared to standard heavy cruisers, and the American Alaska class , which was a scaled-up heavy cruiser design designated as a cruiser-killer.
In the later 20th century, the obsolescence of the battleship left the cruiser as the largest and most powerful surface combatant after the aircraft carrier.
The role of the cruiser varied according to ship and navy, often including air defense and shore bombardment .
During the Cold War , the Soviet Navy's cruisers had heavy anti-ship missile armament designed to sink NATO carrier task forces via saturation attack .
The U.S. Navy built guided-missile cruisers upon destroyer-style hulls (some called destroyer leaders or frigates prior to the 1975 reclassification ) primarily designed to provide air defense while often adding anti-submarine capabilities , being larger and having longer-range surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) than early Charles F.
Adams guided-missile destroyers tasked with the short-range air defense role.
By the end of the Cold War, the line between cruisers and destroyers had blurred, with the Ticonderoga -class cruiser using the hull of the Spruance -class destroyer but receiving the cruiser designation due to their enhanced mission and combat systems.
Indeed, the newest U.S. and Chinese destroyers (for instance the Zumwalt class and Type 055 ) are more heavily armed than some of the cruisers that they succeeded.
Currently only two nations operate cruisers: the United States and Russia , and in both cases the vessels are primarily armed with guided missiles.
BAP Almirante Grau was the last gun cruiser in service, serving with the Peruvian Navy until 2017.

Confidentiality involves a set of rules or a promise usually executed through confidentiality agreements that limits access or places restrictions on certain types of information .
An album is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on compact disc (CD), vinyl , audio tape , or another medium.
Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78-rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album ; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl LP records played at ​ 33 ⁄ 3 rpm .
Vinyl LPs are still issued, though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats.
The audio cassette was a format widely used alongside vinyl from the 1970s into the first decade of the 2000s.
An album may be recorded in a recording studio (fixed or mobile), in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or a mix of places.
The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years.
This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately, and then brought or mixed together.
Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed live, even when done in a studio.
Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation , so as to assist in mixing different takes; other locations, such as concert venues and some live rooms, have reverberation, which creates a live sound.
Recordings, including live, may contain editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc.
With modern recording technology , musicians can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones ; with each part recorded as a separate track .
Album covers and liner notes are used, and sometimes additional information is provided, such as analysis of the recording, and lyrics or librettos .
Historically, the term album was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format.
In musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century.
Later, collections of related 78rpm records were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound).
When long-playing records were introduced, a collection of pieces on a single record was called an album; the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc , MiniDisc , Compact audio cassette , and digital albums as they were introduced.

Training is teaching, or developing in oneself or others, any skills and knowledge that relate to specific useful competencies .
Training has specific goals of improving one's capability , capacity, productivity and performance .
It forms the core of apprenticeships and provides the backbone of content at institutes of technology (also known as technical colleges or polytechnics).
In addition to the basic training required for a trade , occupation or profession , observers of the labor-market recognize as of 2008 the need to continue training beyond initial qualifications: to maintain, upgrade and update skills throughout working life .
People within many professions and occupations may refer to this sort of training as professional development .

The soul , in many religious, philosophical, and mythological traditions, is the incorporeal essence of a living being.
Soul or psyche ( Ancient Greek : ψυχή psykhḗ , of ψύχειν psýkhein , to breathe) comprises the mental abilities of a living being: reason, character, feeling, consciousness, memory, perception, thinking, etc.
Depending on the philosophical system, a soul can either be mortal or immortal .
In Judeo-Christianity , only human beings have immortal souls (although immortality is disputed within Judaism and the concept of immortality may have been influenced by Plato).
For example, the Catholic theologian Thomas Aquinas attributed soul ( anima ) to all organisms but argued that only human souls are immortal.
Other religions (most notably Hinduism and Jainism ) hold that all living things from the smallest bacterium to the largest of mammals are the souls themselves ( Atman , jiva ) and have their physical representative (the body) in the world.
The actual self is the soul, while the body is only a mechanism to experience the karma of that life.
Thus if we see a tiger then there is a self-conscious identity residing in it (the soul), and a physical representative (the whole body of the tiger, which is observable) in the world.
Some teach that even non-biological entities (such as rivers and mountains) possess souls.
This belief is called animism .
Greek philosophers, such as Socrates , Plato , and Aristotle , understood that the soul (ψυχή psūchê ) must have a logical faculty, the exercise of which was the most divine of human actions.
At his defense trial, Socrates even summarized his teaching as nothing other than an exhortation for his fellow Athenians to excel in matters of the psyche since all bodily goods are dependent on such excellence ( Apology 30a–b).
The current consensus of modern science is that there is no evidence to support the existence of the soul when traditionally defined as the spiritual breath of the body.
In metaphysics , the concept of Soul may be equated with that of Mind in order to refer to the consciousness and intellect of the individual.
Kazakhstan ( Kazakh : Қазақстан , romanized: Qazaqstan , IPA: qɑzɑqˈstɑn ( listen ) ), officially the Republic of Kazakhstan (Kazakh: Қазақстан Республикасы , romanized: Qazaqstan Respýblıkasy ; Russian: Республика Казахстан , tr.
Respublika Kazakhstan ), is the world's largest landlocked country , and the ninth largest in the world, with an area of 2,724,900 square kilometres (1,052,100 sq mi).
It is a transcontinental country largely located in Asia ; the most western parts are in Europe .
Kazakhstan is the dominant nation of Central Asia economically, generating 60% of the region's GDP, primarily through its oil and gas industry.
It also has vast mineral resources.
Kazakhstan is officially a democratic, secular, unitary, constitutional republic with a diverse cultural heritage.
Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia , China , Kyrgyzstan , Uzbekistan , and Turkmenistan , and also adjoins a large part of the Caspian Sea .
The terrain of Kazakhstan includes flatlands, steppe , taiga , rock canyons , hills , deltas , snow-capped mountains , and deserts .
Kazakhstan has an estimated 18.3 million people as of 2018 .
Given its large land area, its population density is among the lowest, at less than 6 people per square kilometre (15 people per sq mi).
The capital is Nur-Sultan (until 2019 Astana), where it was moved in 1997 from Almaty , the country's largest city.
The territory of Kazakhstan has historically been inhabited by nomadic groups and empires.
In antiquity, the nomadic Scythians have inhabited the land and the Persian Achaemenid Empire expanded towards the southern territory of the modern country.
Turkic nomads who trace their ancestry to many Turkic states such as Turkic Khaganate etc have inhabited the country throughout the country's history.
In the 13th century, the territory joined the Mongolian Empire under Genghis Khan .
By the 16th century, the Kazakh emerged as a distinct group, divided into three jüz (ancestor branches occupying specific territories).
The Russians began advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the 18th century, and by the mid-19th century, they nominally ruled all of Kazakhstan as part of the Russian Empire .
Following the 1917 Russian Revolution , and subsequent civil war , the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganised several times.
In 1936, it was made the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic , part of the Soviet Union .
Kazakhstan was the last of the Soviet republics to declare independence during the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Nursultan Nazarbayev , the first President of Kazakhstan , was characterized as an authoritarian, and his government was accused of numerous human rights violations, including suppression of dissent and censorship of the media.
Nazarbayev resigned in March 2019, with Senate Chairman Kassym-Jomart Tokayev taking office as Interim President.
Kazakhstan has worked to develop its economy , especially its dominant hydrocarbon industry.
Human Rights Watch says that Kazakhstan heavily restricts freedom of assembly, speech, and religion, and other human rights organisations regularly describe Kazakhstan's human rights situation as poor.
Kazakhstan's 131 ethnicities include Kazakhs (63% of the population), Russians , Uzbeks , Ukrainians , Germans , Tatars , and Uyghurs .
Islam is the religion of about 70% of the population, with Christianity practised by 26%.
Kazakhstan officially allows freedom of religion , but religious leaders who oppose the government are suppressed.
The Kazakh language is the state language , and Russian has equal official status for all levels of administrative and institutional purposes.
Kazakhstan is a member of the United Nations , WTO , CIS , the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) , the Eurasian Economic Union , CSTO , OSCE , OIC , and TURKSOY .

Electronic mail ( email or e-mail ) is a method of exchanging messages ( mail ) between people using electronic devices.
Invented by Ray Tomlinson , email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email.
Email operates across computer networks , which today is primarily the Internet .
Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time, in common with instant messaging .
Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model.
Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages.
Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect only briefly, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface for as long as it takes to send or receive messages.
Originally an ASCII text-only communications medium, Internet email was extended by Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments.
International email , with internationalized email addresses using UTF-8 , has been standardized, but as of 2017 it has not been widely adopted.
The history of modern Internet email services reaches back to the early ARPANET , with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 ( RFC 561 ).
An email message sent in the early 1970s looks very similar to a basic email sent today.
Email had an important role in creating the Internet, and the conversion from ARPANET to the Internet in the early 1980s produced the core of the current services.

Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl), a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts ; salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite .
Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater , where it is the main mineral constituent.
The open ocean has about 35 grams (1.2 oz) of solids per liter of sea water, a salinity of 3.5%.
Salt is essential for life in general , and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes .
Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings , and salting is an important method of food preservation .
Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6,000 BC, when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period.
Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews , the Greeks , the Romans , the Byzantines , the Hittites , Egyptians , and the Indians .
Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans.
The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues.
Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance.
Salt is processed from salt mines , and by the evaporation of seawater ( sea salt ) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools.
Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine ; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride , plastics , paper pulp and many other products.
Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, about 6% is used for human consumption.
Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use.
Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency .
As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.
Sodium is an essential nutrient for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute .
Excessive salt consumption may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases , such as hypertension , in children and adults.
Such health effects of salt have long been studied.
Accordingly, numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods.
The World Health Organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt per day.
North is one of the four compass points or cardinal directions .
It is the opposite of south and is perpendicular to east and west .
North is a noun , adjective , or adverb indicating direction or geography .
A transformer is a passive electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits .
A varying current in one coil of the transformer produces a varying magnetic flux , which, in turn, induces a varying electromotive force across a second coil wound around the same core.Electrical energy can be transferred between the two coils, without a metallic connection between the two circuits.
Faraday's law of induction discovered in 1831 described the induced voltage effect in any coil due to changing magnetic flux encircled by the coil.
Transformers are used for increasing or decreasing the alternating voltages in electric power applications, and for coupling the stages of signal processing circuits.
Since the invention of the first constant-potential transformer in 1885, transformers have become essential for the transmission , distribution , and utilization of alternating current electric power.
A wide range of transformer designs is encountered in electronic and electric power applications.
Transformers range in size from RF transformers less than a cubic centimeter in volume, to units weighing hundreds of tons used to interconnect the power grid .
Employment is a relationship between two parties , usually based on a contract where work is paid for, where one party, which may be a corporation , for profit , not-for-profit organization , co-operative or other entity is the employer and the other is the employee .
Employees work in return for payment , which may be in the form of an hourly wage, by piecework or an annual salary , depending on the type of work an employee does or which sector they are working in.
Employees in some fields or sectors may receive gratuities , bonus payment or stock options .
In some types of employment, employees may receive benefits in addition to payment.
Benefits can include health insurance , housing , disability insurance or use of a gym.
Employment is typically governed by employment laws , regulations or legal contracts.

A consul is an official representative of the government of one state in the territory of another, normally acting to assist and protect the citizens of the consul's own country, and to facilitate trade and friendship between the people of the two countries.
A consul is distinguished from an ambassador , the latter being a representative from one head of state to another.
There can be only one ambassador from one country to another, representing the first country's head of state to that of the second, and his or her duties revolve around diplomatic relations between the two countries; however, there may be several consuls, one in each of several major cities, providing assistance with bureaucratic issues to both the citizens of the consul's own country traveling or living abroad and to the citizens of the country in which the consul resides who wish to travel to or trade with the consul's country.
A less common usage is an administrative consul , who takes a governing role and is appointed by a country that has colonised or occupied another.
Radio is the technology of signaling or communicating using radio waves .
Radio waves are electromagnetic waves of frequency between 30 hertz (Hz) and 300 gigahertz (GHz).
They are generated by an electronic device called a transmitter connected to an antenna which radiates the waves, and received by a radio receiver connected to another antenna.
Radio is very widely used in modern technology, in radio communication, radar , radio navigation , remote control , remote sensing and other applications.
In radio communication , used in radio and television broadcasting , cell phones , two-way radios , wireless networking and satellite communication among numerous other uses, radio waves are used to carry information across space from a transmitter to a receiver, by modulating the radio signal (impressing an information signal on the radio wave by varying some aspect of the wave) in the transmitter.
In radar , used to locate and track objects like aircraft, ships, spacecraft and missiles, a beam of radio waves emitted by a radar transmitter reflects off the target object, and the reflected waves reveal the object's location.
In radio navigation systems such as GPS and VOR , a mobile receiver receives radio signals from navigational radio beacons whose position is known, and by precisely measuring the arrival time of the radio waves the receiver can calculate its position on Earth.
In wireless radio remote control devices like drones , garage door openers , and keyless entry systems , radio signals transmitted from a controller device control the actions of a remote device.
Applications of radio waves which do not involve transmitting the waves significant distances, such as RF heating used in industrial processes and microwave ovens , and medical uses such as diathermy and MRI machines , are not usually called radio .
The noun radio is also used to mean a broadcast radio receiver .
Radio waves were first identified and studied by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1886.
The first practical radio transmitters and receivers were developed around 1895-6 by Italian Guglielmo Marconi , and radio began to be used commercially around 1900.
To prevent interference between users, the emission of radio waves is strictly regulated by law, coordinated by an international body called the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which allocates frequency bands in the radio spectrum for different uses.
An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office .
Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.
Elections may fill offices in the legislature , sometimes in the executive and judiciary , and for regional and local government .
This process is also used in many other private and business organizations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations .
The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype , ancient Athens , where the Elections were not used were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition , also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.
Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems.
Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).
To elect means to choose or make a decision, and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States.
A prefecture (from the Latin Praefectura ) is an administrative jurisdiction or subdivision in any of various countries and within some international church structures, and in antiquity a Roman district governed by an appointed prefect.

Somalia ( sə- MAH -lee-ə ; Somali : Soomaaliya ; Arabic : الصومال ‎, romanized : aṣ-Ṣūmāl ), officially the Federal Republic of Somalia ( Somali : Jamhuuriyadda Federaalka Soomaaliya ; Arabic : جمهورية الصومال الفيدرالية ‎, romanized : Jumhūrīyah aṣ-Ṣūmāl al-Fīdirālīyah ), is a country located in the Horn of Africa .
It is bordered by Ethiopia to the west, Djibouti to the northwest, the Gulf of Aden to the north, the Guardafui Channel and Somali Sea to the east, and Kenya to the southwest.
Somalia has the longest coastline on Africa 's mainland, and its terrain consists mainly of plateaus, plains and highlands.
Climatically, hot conditions prevail year-round, with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall.
Somalia has an estimated population of around 14.3 million.
, and has been described as the most culturally homogeneous country in Africa.
Around 85% of its residents are ethnic Somalis , who have historically inhabited the northern part of the country.
Ethnic minorities are largely concentrated in the southern regions.
The official languages of Somalia are Somali and Arabic .
Most people in the country are Muslim , the majority of which belong to the Sunni sect of Islam.
In antiquity, Somalia was an important commercial centre.
It is among the most probable locations of the fabled ancient Land of Punt .
During the Middle Ages, several powerful Somali empires dominated the regional trade, including the Ajuran Empire , the Adal Sultanate , the Warsangali Sultanate , and the Sultanate of the Geledi .
The toponym Somalia was coined by the Italian explorer Luigi Robecchi Bricchetti (1855–1926).
In the late 19th century, the British and Italian empires established the colonies of British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland .
In the interior, Mohammed Abdullah Hassan 's Darwiish repelled the British four times, forcing a retreat to the coast, before succumbing in the Somaliland campaign (1920) .
Italy acquired full control of the northeastern, central and southern parts of the area after successfully waging the Campaign of the Sultanates against the ruling Majeerteen Sultanate and Sultanate of Hobyo .
In 1960, the two regions united to form the independent Somali Republic under a civilian government.
The Supreme Revolutionary Council seized power in 1969 and established the Somali Democratic Republic , which collapsed in 1991 as the Somali Civil War broke out.
During this period most regions returned to customary and religious law .
The early 2000s saw the creation of interim federal administrations.
The Transitional National Government (TNG) was established in 2000, followed by the formation of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004, which reestablished the military .
In 2006, the TFG assumed control of most of the nation's southern conflict zones from the newly formed Islamic Courts Union (ICU).
The ICU subsequently splintered into more radical groups such as Al-Shabaab , which battled the TFG and its AMISOM allies for control of the region.
By mid-2012, the insurgents had lost most of the territory that they had seized, and a search for more permanent democratic institutions began.
A new provisional constitution was passed in August 2012, which reformed Somalia as a federation .
The same month, the Federal Government of Somalia was formed and a period of reconstruction began in Mogadishu .
Somalia has maintained an informal economy , mainly based on livestock, remittances from Somalis working abroad, and telecommunications.
It is a member of the United Nations , the Arab League , African Union , Non-Aligned Movement and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation .
Poisoning is a condition or a process in which an organism becomes chemically harmed severely ( poisoned ) by a toxic substance or venom of an animal .
Acute poisoning is exposure to a poison on one occasion or during a short period of time.
Symptoms develop in close relation to the degree of exposure .
Absorption of a poison is necessary for systemic poisoning (that is, in the blood throughout the body).
In contrast, substances that destroy tissue but do not absorb, such as lye , are classified as corrosives rather than poisons.
Furthermore, many common household medications are not labeled with skull and crossbones , although they can cause severe illness or even death.
In the medical sense, toxicity and poisoning can be caused by less dangerous substances than those legally classified as a poison.
Toxicology is the study and practice of the symptoms, mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment of poisoning.
Chronic poisoning is long-term repeated or continuous exposure to a poison where symptoms do not occur immediately or after each exposure.
The patient gradually becomes ill, or becomes ill after a long latent period.
Chronic poisoning most commonly occurs following exposure to poisons that bioaccumulate , or are biomagnified , such as mercury , gadolinium, and lead .
Contact or absorption of poisons can cause rapid death or impairment.
Agents that act on the nervous system can paralyze in seconds or less, and include both biologically derived neurotoxins and so-called nerve gases , which may be synthesized for warfare or industry.
Inhaled or ingested cyanide , used as a method of execution in gas chambers , almost instantly starves the body of energy by inhibiting the enzymes in mitochondria that make ATP .
Intravenous injection of an unnaturally high concentration of potassium chloride , such as in the execution of prisoners in parts of the United States, quickly stops the heart by eliminating the cell potential necessary for muscle contraction .
Most biocides, including pesticides , are created to act as poisons to target organisms, although acute or less observable chronic poisoning can also occur in non-target organisms ( secondary poisoning ), including the humans who apply the biocides and other beneficial organisms .
For example, the herbicide 2,4-D imitates the action of a plant hormone, which makes its lethal toxicity specific to plants.
Indeed, 2,4-D is not a poison, but classified as harmful (EU).
Many substances regarded as poisons are toxic only indirectly, by toxication .
An example is wood alcohol or methanol , which is not poisonous itself, but is chemically converted to toxic formaldehyde and formic acid in the liver .
Many drug molecules are made toxic in the liver, and the genetic variability of certain liver enzymes makes the toxicity of many compounds differ between individuals.
Exposure to radioactive substances can produce radiation poisoning , an unrelated phenomenon.
Freon ( FREE -on ) is a registered trademark of The Chemours Company , which uses it for a number of halocarbon products.
They are stable, nonflammable, low toxicity gases or liquids which have generally been used as refrigerants and as aerosol propellants .
These include the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that cause ozone depletion and HCFCs (such as chlorodifluoromethane ).
Not all refrigerants of this type are labelled as Freon since Freon is a brand name for the refrigerants R-12 , R-13B1 , R-22 , R-410A , R-502, and R-503 manufactured by The Chemours Company.
The term freon is a common descriptor or proprietary eponym (similar to a generic trademark ) like xerox or kleenex .
It is commonly used when referring to any fluorocarbon refrigerants.
Gaijin ( 外人 , ɡai(d)ʑĩɴ ; outsider, alien, Non-Japanese) is a Japanese word for foreigners and non-Japanese.
The word is composed of two kanji : gai ( 外 , outside) and jin ( 人 , person) .
Similarly composed words that refer to foreign things include gaikoku ( 外国 , foreign country) and gaisha ( 外車 , foreign car) .
The word can refer to nationality , race or ethnicity , concepts generally conflated in Japan.
Some feel the word has come to have a negative or pejorative connotation, while other observers maintain it is neutral or even positive.
Gaikokujin ( 外国人 , gaikokɯꜜ(d)ʑĩɴ ; foreign-country person) is a more neutral and somewhat more formal term widely used in the Japanese government and in media.
Grasslands are areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses ( Poaceae ); however, sedge ( Cyperaceae ) and rush ( Juncaceae ) families can also be found along with variable proportions of legumes , like clover , and other herbs .
Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica .
Grasslands are found in most ecoregions of the Earth .
For example, there are five terrestrial ecoregion classifications (subdivisions) of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome ( ecosystem ), which is one of eight terrestrial ecozones .
Prostitution is the business or practice of engaging in sexual activity in exchange for payment .
Prostitution is sometimes described as sexual services , commercial sex or, colloquially, hooking .
It is sometimes referred to euphemistically as the world's oldest profession in the English-speaking world .
A person who works in this field is called a prostitute , and is a type of sex worker .
Prostitution occurs in a variety of forms, and its legal status varies from country to country (sometimes from region to region within a given country), ranging from being an enforced or unenforced crime, to unregulated, to a regulated profession.
It is one branch of the sex industry , along with pornography , stripping , and erotic dancing .
Brothels are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution.
In escort prostitution , the act may take place at the client's residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at the escort's residence or a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort (in-call).
Another form is street prostitution .
There are about 42 million prostitutes in the world, living all over the world (though most of Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa lacks data, studied countries in that large region rank as top sex tourism destinations).
Estimates place the annual revenue generated by prostitution worldwide to be over $100 billion.
The majority of prostitutes are female and have male clients.
The position of prostitution and the law varies widely worldwide, reflecting differing opinions.
Some view prostitution as a form of exploitation of or violence against women , and children , that helps to create a supply of victims for human trafficking .
Some critics of prostitution as an institution are supporters of the Swedish approach , which decriminalizes the act of selling sex, but makes the purchase of sex illegal.
This approach has also been adopted by Canada , Iceland , the Republic of Ireland , Northern Ireland , Norway , and France .
Others view sex work as a legitimate occupation, whereby a person trades or exchanges sexual acts for money.
Amnesty International is one of the notable groups calling for the decriminalization of prostitution.
Adolescence (from Latin adolescere , meaning 'to grow up') is a transitional stage of physical and psychological development that generally occurs during the period from puberty to legal adulthood ( age of majority ).
Adolescence is usually associated with the teenage years, but its physical, psychological or cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later.
For example, puberty now typically begins during preadolescence , particularly in females.
Physical growth (particularly in males) and cognitive development can extend into the early twenties.
Thus, age provides only a rough marker of adolescence, and scholars have found it difficult to agree upon a precise definition of adolescence.
A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology.
Within all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles.
It is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment, and unemployment, as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another.
The end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country.
Furthermore, even within a single nation state or culture, there can be different ages at which an individual is considered mature enough for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities.
Such privileges and responsibilities include driving a vehicle, having legal sexual relations, serving in the armed forces or on a jury, purchasing and drinking alcohol, voting, entering into contracts, finishing certain levels of education, marriage, and accountability for upholding the law.
Adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians, including less supervision as compared to preadolescence.
In studying adolescent development, adolescence can be defined biologically, as the physical transition marked by the onset of puberty and the termination of physical growth; cognitively, as changes in the ability to think abstractly and multi-dimensionally; or socially, as a period of preparation for adult roles.
Major pubertal and biological changes include changes to the sex organs , height, weight, and muscle mass , as well as major changes in brain structure and organization.
Cognitive advances encompass both increment in knowledge and in the ability to think abstractly and to reason more effectively.
The study of adolescent development often involves interdisciplinary collaborations.
For example, researchers in neuroscience or bio-behavioral health might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure and its effects on cognition or social relations.
Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles (e.g., worker or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions.
Developmental psychologists might focus on changes in relations with parents and peers as a function of school structure and pubertal status.
Some scientists have questioned the universality of adolescence as a developmental phase, arguing that traits often considered typical of adolescents are not in fact inherent to the teenage years.
A coffeehouse , coffee shop , or café is an establishment that primarily serves coffee , related coffee drinks ( latte , cappuccino , espresso ), and – depending on country – other drinks including alcoholic.
Some coffeehouses may serve cold drinks such as iced coffee and iced tea ; in continental Europe , cafés serve alcoholic drinks.
A coffeehouse may also serve some type of food, such as light snacks , sandwiches , muffins or other pastries .
Coffeehouses range from owner-operated small businesses to large multinational corporations.
Some coffeehouses are franchise based business models, with numerous branches across various countries all around the world.
While café may refer to a coffeehouse, the term cafe generally refers to a diner , British cafe (colloquially called a caff), greasy spoon (a small and inexpensive restaurant), transport cafe , teahouse or tea room , or other casual eating and drinking place.
A coffeehouse may share some of the same characteristics of a bar or restaurant , but it is different from a cafeteria .
Many coffeehouses in the Middle East and in West Asian immigrant districts in the Western world offer shisha ( nargile in Greek and Turkish), flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah .
Espresso bars are a type of coffeehouse that specializes in serving espresso and espresso-based drinks.
From a cultural standpoint, coffeehouses largely serve as centers of social interaction: the coffeehouse provides patrons with a place to congregate, talk, read, write, entertain one another, or pass the time, whether individually or in small groups.
Since the development of Wi-Fi , coffeehouses with this capability have also become places for patrons to access the Internet on their laptops and tablet computers .
A coffeehouse can serve as an informal club for its regular members.
As early as the 1950s Beatnik era and the 1960s folk music scene, coffeehouses have hosted singer-songwriter performances, typically in the evening.

In general, corruption is a form of dishonesty or criminal activity undertaken by a person or organization entrusted with a position of authority, often to acquire illicit benefit, or, abuse of entrusted power for one's private gain, as said otherwise.
Corruption may include many activities including bribery and embezzlement , though it may also involve practices that are legal in many countries.
Political corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain.
Corruption is most commonplace in kleptocracies , oligarchies , narco-states and mafia states .
This is the working definition used by Transparency International (TI), applying to both the public and private sectors.
The CPI focuses on corruption in the public sector, or corruption which involves public officials, civil servants or politicians.
Corruption can occur on different scales.
Corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption), to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime.
Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degree and proportion.
Individual nations each allocate domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and crime.
Strategies to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term anti-corruption .
An apartment ( American English ), flat ( British English ) or unit ( Australian English ) is a self-contained housing unit (a type of residential real estate ) that occupies only part of a building, generally on a single storey .
There are many names for these overall buildings, see below.
The housing tenure of apartments also varies considerably, from large-scale public housing , to owner occupancy within what is legally a condominium ( strata title or commonhold ), to tenants renting from a private landlord (see leasehold estate ).

Afghanistan ( ( listen ) ; Pashto / Dari : افغانستان, Pashto: Afġānistān avɣɒnisˈtɒn, ab- , Dari: Afġānestān avɣɒnesˈtɒn ), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan , is a landlocked country located in South - Central Asia .
Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Tajikistan in the north; and in the far northeast, China .
Much of its 652,000 square kilometers (252,000 sq mi) is covered by the Hindu Kush mountain range at the western end of the Himalayas , separating the Amu Darya and Indus valleys.
Kabul is the capital and largest city.
Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era, and the country's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia.
The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by Alexander the Great , Mauryas , Muslim Arabs , Mongols , British , Soviets , and since 2001 by the United States with NATO -allied countries.
It has been called, unconquerable and nicknamed the, graveyard of empires, though it has been occupied during several different periods of its history.
The land also served as the source from which the Kushans , Hephthalites , Samanids , Saffarids , Ghaznavids , Ghorids , Khaljis , Mughals , Hotaks , Durranis , and others have risen to form major empires.
The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century.
In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between British India and the Russian Empire .
Its border with British India, the Durand Line , was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter's independence in 1947.
Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence, eventually becoming a monarchy under King Amanullah , until almost 50 years later when Zahir Shah was overthrown and a republic was established.
In 1978, after a second coup Afghanistan first became a socialist state and then a Soviet Union protectorate.
This evoked the Soviet–Afghan War in the 1980s against mujahideen rebels.
By 1996 most of Afghanistan was captured by the Islamic fundamentalist group the Taliban , who ruled most of the country as a totalitarian regime for over five years .
The Taliban were forcibly removed by the NATO -led coalition , and a new democratically-elected government political structure was formed, but they still control a significant portion of the country.
Afghanistan is a unitary presidential Islamic republic with a population of 31 million, mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns , Tajiks , Hazaras and Uzbeks .
It is a member of the United Nations , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , the Group of 77 , the Economic Cooperation Organization , and the Non-Aligned Movement .
Afghanistan's economy is the world's 108th largest, with a GDP of $64.08 billion; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 167th out of 186 countries in a 2016 report from the International Monetary Fund .
A clinic (or outpatient clinic or ambulatory care clinic ) is a healthcare facility that is primarily focused on the care of outpatients .
Clinics can be privately operated or publicly managed and funded.
They typically cover the primary healthcare needs of populations in local communities, in contrast to larger hospitals which offer specialised treatments and admit inpatients for overnight stays.
Most commonly, the English word clinic refers to a general medical practice, run by one or more general practitioners , but it can also mean a specialist clinic.
Some clinics retain the name clinic even while growing into institutions as large as major hospitals or becoming associated with a hospital or medical school .
A wedding is a ceremony where two people are united in marriage .
Wedding traditions and customs vary greatly between cultures, ethnic groups , religions, countries, and social classes.
Most wedding ceremonies involve an exchange of marriage vows by the couple, presentation of a gift (offering, rings, symbolic item, flowers, money), and a public proclamation of marriage by an authority figure or celebrant.
Special wedding garments are often worn, and the ceremony is sometimes followed by a wedding reception .
Music, poetry, prayers or readings from religious texts or literature are also commonly incorporated into the ceremony, as well as superstitious customs originating in Ancient Rome.
East is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass .
It is the opposite direction from west .
The human back is the large posterior area of the human body , rising from the top of the buttocks to the back of the neck and the shoulders.
It is the surface of the body opposite from the chest .
The vertebral column runs the length of the back and creates a central area of recession.
The breadth of the back is created by the shoulders at the top and the pelvis at the bottom.
Back pain is a common medical condition, generally benign in origin.
Silk is a natural protein fiber , some forms of which can be woven into textiles .
The protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons.
The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity ( sericulture ).
The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism -like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles , thus producing different colors.
Silk is produced by several insects; but, generally, only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing.
There has been some research into other types of silk, which differ at the molecular level.
Silk is mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis , but some insects, such as webspinners and raspy crickets , produce silk throughout their lives.
Silk production also occurs in Hymenoptera ( bees , wasps , and ants ), silverfish , mayflies , thrips , leafhoppers , beetles , lacewings , fleas , flies , and midges .
Other types of arthropods produce silk, most notably various arachnids , such as spiders .

Ink is a liquid or paste that contains pigments or dyes and is used to color a surface to produce an image , text , or design .
Ink is used for drawing or writing with a pen , brush , or quill .
Thicker inks, in paste form, are used extensively in letterpress and lithographic printing .
Ink can be a complex medium, composed of solvents , pigments, dyes, resins , lubricants , solubilizers , surfactants , particulate matter , fluorescents , and other materials.
The components of inks serve many purposes; the ink's carrier, colorants, and other additives affect the flow and thickness of the ink and its dry appearance.
In 2011 worldwide consumption of printing inks generated revenues of more than 20 billion US dollars.
Demand by traditional print media is shrinking, on the other hand more and more printing inks are consumed for packagings.

Laos ( ( listen ) , ; Lao : ລາວ , Lāo láːw ), officially the Lao People's Democratic Republic ( Lao : ສາທາລະນະລັດ ປະຊາທິປະໄຕ ປະຊາຊົນລາວ , romanized : Sathalanalat Paxathipatai Paxaxon Lao ; French : République démocratique populaire lao ), commonly referred to by its colloquial name of Muang Lao ( Lao : ເມືອງລາວ, Muang Lao ), is a socialist state and the only landlocked country in Southeast Asia.
Located at the heart of the Indochinese peninsula , Laos is bordered by Myanmar (Burma) and China to the northwest, Vietnam to the east, Cambodia to the southeast, and Thailand to the west and southwest.
Present-day Laos traces its historic and cultural identity to the kingdom of Lan Xang Hom Khao (Kingdom of a Million Elephants Under the White Parasol), which existed for four centuries as one of the largest kingdoms in Southeast Asia .
Due to Lan Xang's central geographical location in Southeast Asia, the kingdom became a popular hub for overland trade, becoming wealthy economically as well as culturally.
After a period of internal conflict, Lan Xang broke off into three separate kingdoms— Luang Phrabang , Vientiane , and Champasak .
In 1893, it became a French protectorate , with the three territories uniting to form what is now known as the country of Laos.
It briefly gained independence in 1945 after Japanese occupation , but was recolonised by France until it won autonomy in 1949.
Laos became independent in 1953, with a constitutional monarchy under Sisavang Vong .
Shortly after independence, a long civil war began, which saw the communist resistance , supported by the Soviet Union , fight against, first, the monarchy and then a number of military dictatorships, supported by the United States .
After the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the Communist Pathet Lao movement came to power, seeing the end to the civil war.
During the first years of Communist rule, Laos was dependent on military and economic aid supported by the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991.
In 2018, the country had the fourth highest GDP (PPP) per capita in Southeast Asia , after Singapore , Malaysia , and Thailand .
In the same year, the country ranked 139th on the Human Development Index (HDI), indicating medium development.
Laos is a member of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), East Asia Summit , and La Francophonie .
Laos applied for membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1997; on 2 February 2013, it was granted full membership.
It is a one-party socialist republic , espousing Marxism–Leninism governed by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party .
The capital and largest city in Laos is Vientiane .
Other major cities include Luang Prabang , Savannakhet , and Pakse .
The official language is Lao .
Laos is a multi-ethnic country, with the politically and culturally dominant Lao people making up about 55 percent of the population, mostly in the lowlands.
Mon-Khmer groups, the Hmong , and other indigenous hill tribes, accounting for 45 percent of the population, live in the foothills and mountains.
Laos's strategies for development are based on generating electricity from its rivers and selling the power to its neighbours, namely Thailand , China , and Vietnam , as well as its initiative to become a land-linked nation, shown by the construction of four new railways connecting Laos to its neighbours .
Laos has been referred to as one of East Asia and Pacific's Fastest Growing Economies by the World Bank , with annual GDP growth averaging 7.8% for the past decade.
Nekhbet ( ; also spelt Nekhebit) was an early predynastic local goddess in Egyptian mythology , who was the patron of the city of Nekheb (her name meaning of Nekheb ).
Ultimately, she became the patron of Upper Egypt and one of the two patron deities for all of Ancient Egypt when it was unified.

A signature ( ; from Latin : signare , to sign) is a handwritten (and often stylized) depiction of someone's name, nickname, or even a simple X or other mark that a person writes on documents as a proof of identity and intent.
The writer of a signature is a signatory or signer .
Similar to a handwritten signature, a signature work describes the work as readily identifying its creator.
A signature may be confused with an autograph , which is chiefly an artistic signature.
This can lead to confusion when people have both an autograph and signature and as such some people in the public eye keep their signatures private whilst fully publishing their autograph.
A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of part or all of an organism, and that is not due to any external injury.
Diseases are often construed as medical conditions that are associated with specific symptoms and signs .
A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions.
For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency , hypersensitivity , allergies and autoimmune disorders .
In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain , dysfunction , distress , social problems , or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person.
In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries , disabilities , disorders , syndromes , infections , isolated symptoms , deviant behaviors , and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories.
Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life.
Death due to disease is called death by natural causes .
There are four main types of disease: infectious diseases , deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases ), and physiological diseases.
Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as communicable versus non-communicable diseases.
The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections .
In developed countries, the diseases that cause the most sickness overall are neuropsychiatric conditions , such as depression and anxiety .
The study of disease is called pathology , which includes the study of etiology , or cause.
A skill is the ability to carry out a task with determined results often within a given amount of time, energy, or both.
Skills can often be divided into domain -general and domain-specific skills.
For example, in the domain of work, some general skills would include time management , teamwork and leadership, self-motivation and others, whereas domain-specific skills would be used only for a certain job.
Skill usually requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used.
People need a broad range of skills to contribute to a modern economy.
A joint ASTD and U.S. Department of Labor study showed that through technology, the workplace is changing, and identified 16 basic skills that employees must have to be able to change with it.
Three broad categories of skills are suggested and these are technical, human, and conceptual.
The first two can be substituted with hard and soft skills, respectively.

Uncle (from Latin : avunculus the diminutive of avus grandfather) is a male family relationship or kinship within an extended or immediate family.
Uncles are second-degree relatives and share 25% genetic overlap when they are the full brother of one of the biological parents.
An uncle is the brother of one's parent.
A half-uncle is the half-brother of one's parent.
Uncle-in-law can refer to the husband of one's aunt (sister of one's parent) or uncle of one's spouse.
A biological uncle is a second degree male relative and shares 25% genetic overlap.
However people who are not a biological uncle are sometimes affectionately called as an uncle as a title of admiration and respect.
A woman with the equivalent relationship of an uncle is an aunt .
The reciprocal relationship to both of these is that of a nephew or niece .
A grand-uncle or granduncle or great-uncle is the brother of one's grandparent.
Half-great-uncle or half-granduncle is the half-brother of one's grandparent.
Great-uncle-in-law or granduncle-in-law is the husband of one's great-aunt or grandaunt (sister of one's grandparent).
Great-uncle-in-law or granduncle-in-law and can also be great-uncle or granduncle of one's spouse.
A great-great-uncle or great-granduncle is the brother of one's great-grandparent.
A half-great-great-uncle or half-great-granduncle is the half-brother of one's great-grandparent.
A cousin-uncle is the male cousin of one's parent.
As they are in first degree relatives to your parents they become a second degree relative to you as you are the generation below your parents.
They are called uncle simply because they lie a generation above you.
Their child would be called in reference to yourself, your second cousin as they are on your generation level.
Fear is a feeling induced by perceived danger or threat that occurs in certain types of organisms , which causes a change in metabolic and organ functions and ultimately a change in behavior , such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events.
Fear in human beings may occur in response to a certain stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to body or life.
The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response ), which in extreme cases of fear ( horror and terror ) can be a freeze response or paralysis .
In humans and animals, fear is modulated by the process of cognition and learning.
Thus fear is judged as rational or appropriate and irrational or inappropriate.
An irrational fear is called a phobia .
Psychologists such as John B.
Watson , Robert Plutchik , and Paul Ekman have suggested that there is only a small set of basic or innate emotions and that fear is one of them.
This hypothesized set includes such emotions as acute stress reaction , anger , angst , anxiety , fright, horror , joy , panic , and sadness .
Fear is closely related to, but should be distinguished from, the emotion anxiety , which occurs as the result of threats that are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable.
The fear response serves survival by engendering appropriate behavioral responses, so it has been preserved throughout evolution .
Sociological and organizational research also suggests that individuals fears are not solely dependent on their nature but are also shaped by their social relations and culture, which guide their understanding of when and how much fear to feel.
A biomarker , or biological marker is a measurable indicator of some biological state or condition.
Biomarkers are often measured and evaluated to examine normal biological processes , pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention .
Biomarkers are used in many scientific fields .
Shit is a word generally considered to be vulgar and profane in Modern English .
As a noun, it refers to fecal matter, and as a verb it means to defecate ; in the plural (the shits), it means diarrhoea .
Shite is a common variant in British and Irish English .
As a slang term, it has many meanings, including: nonsense, foolishness, something of little value or quality, trivial and usually boastful or inaccurate talk or a contemptible person.
It could also be used to refer to any other noun in general or as an expression of annoyance, surprise or anger.

An engagement , betrothal , or fiancer is the relationship between two people who want to get married, and also the period of time between a marriage proposal and a marriage .
During this period, a couple is said to be betrothed, intended , affianced , engaged to be married, or simply engaged .
Future brides and grooms may be called the betrothed , a wife-to-be or husband-to-be , fiancée or fiancé (from the French word of the same form ), respectively.
The duration of the courtship varies vastly, and is largely dependent on cultural norms or upon the agreement of the parties involved.
Long engagements were once common in formal arranged marriages , and it was not uncommon for parents betrothing children to arrange marriages many years before the engaged couple were old enough.
This is still common in some countries.
Peter may refer to:
A hairdresser is a person whose occupation is to cut or style hair in order to change or maintain a person's image.
This is achieved using a combination of hair coloring , haircutting , and hair texturing techniques.
Most hairdressers are professionally licensed as either a hairdresser, a barber or a cosmetologist .
A street is a public thoroughfare in a built environment .
It is a public parcel of land adjoining buildings in an urban context, on which people may freely assemble, interact, and move about.
A street can be as simple as a level patch of dirt , but is more often paved with a hard, durable surface such as tarmac , concrete , cobblestone or brick .
Portions may also be smoothed with asphalt , embedded with rails , or otherwise prepared to accommodate non- pedestrian traffic.
Originally, the word street simply meant a paved road ( Latin : via strata ).
The word street is still sometimes used informally as a synonym for road , for example in connection with the ancient Watling Street , but city residents and urban planners draw a crucial modern distinction: a road's main function is transportation, while streets facilitate public interaction.
Examples of streets include pedestrian streets , alleys , and city-centre streets too crowded for road vehicles to pass.
Conversely, highways and motorways are types of roads, but few would refer to them as streets.
Cobra is the common name of various elapid snakes , most of which belonging to the genus Naja .
Dairy farming is a class of agriculture for long-term production of milk , which is processed (either on the farm or at a dairy plant, either of which may be called a dairy ) for eventual sale of a dairy product .
A factory, manufacturing plant or a production plant is an industrial site, usually consisting of buildings and machinery, or more commonly a complex having several buildings, where workers manufacture goods or operate machines processing one product into another.
Factories arose with the introduction of machinery during the Industrial Revolution when the capital and space requirements became too great for cottage industry or workshops.
Early factories that contained small amounts of machinery, such as one or two spinning mules , and fewer than a dozen workers have been called glorified workshops.
Most modern factories have large warehouses or warehouse -like facilities that contain heavy equipment used for assembly line production.
Large factories tend to be located with access to multiple modes of transportation, with some having rail, highway and water loading and unloading facilities.
Factories may either make discrete products or some type of material continuously produced such as chemicals , pulp and paper , or refined oil products .
Factories manufacturing chemicals are often called plants and may have most of their equipment – tanks, pressure vessels , chemical reactors , pumps and piping – outdoors and operated from control rooms .
Oil refineries have most of their equipment outdoors.
Discrete products may be final consumer goods, or parts and sub-assemblies which are made into final products elsewhere.
Factories may be supplied parts from elsewhere or make them from raw materials.
Continuous production industries typically use heat or electricity to transform streams of raw materials into finished products.
The term mill originally referred to the milling of grain, which usually used natural resources such as water or wind power until those were displaced by steam power in the 19th century.
Because many processes like spinning and weaving, iron rolling, and paper manufacturing were originally powered by water, the term survives as in steel mill , paper mill , etc.
An expert is someone who has a prolonged or intense experience through practice and education in a particular field.
Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain.
An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study.
Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study.
An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential , training , education , profession , publication or experience , to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally ) rely upon the individual's opinion .
Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage ( Sophos ).
The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment .
In specific fields, the definition of expert is well established by consensus and therefore it is not always necessary for individuals to have a professional or academic qualification for them to be accepted as an expert.
In this respect, a shepherd with 50 years of experience tending flocks would be widely recognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs and the care of sheep.
Another example from computer science is that an expert system may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert, often outperforming human beings at particular tasks.
In law , an expert witness must be recognized by argument and authority .
Research in this area attempts to understand the relation between expert knowledge, skills and personal characteristics and exceptional performance.
Some researchers have investigated the cognitive structures and processes of experts.
The fundamental aim of this research is to describe what it is that experts know and how they use their knowledge to achieve performance that most people assume requires extreme or extraordinary ability.
Studies have investigated the factors that enable experts to be fast and accurate.
A skirt is the lower part of a dress or gown , covering the person from the waist downwards, or a separate outer garment serving this purpose.
The hemline of skirts can vary from micro to floor-length and can vary according to cultural conceptions of modesty and aesthetics as well as the wearer's personal taste, which can be influenced by such factors as fashion and social context.
Most skirts are self-standing garments, but some skirt-looking panels may be part of another garment such as leggings , shorts , and swimsuits .
In modern times skirts are typically worn by women with some exceptions such as the izaar which is worn by Muslim cultures and the kilt which is a traditional men's garment in Scotland and Ireland and sometimes England .
Fashion designers such as Jean Paul Gaultier , Vivienne Westwood , Kenzo and Marc Jacobs have shown men's skirts .
Transgressing social codes, Gaultier frequently introduces the skirt into his men's wear collections as a means of injecting novelty into male attire, most famously the sarong seen on David Beckham .
At its simplest, a skirt can be a draped garment made out of a single piece of fabric (such as pareos ), but most skirts are fitted to the body at the waist or hips and fuller below, with the fullness introduced by means of darts , gores, pleats , or panels.
Modern skirts are usually made of light to mid-weight fabrics , such as denim , jersey, worsted, or poplin.
Skirts of thin or clingy fabrics are often worn with slips to make the material of the skirt drape better and for modesty.
A barrel or cask is a hollow cylindrical container with a bulging center, longer than it is wide.
They were originally made of wooden staves and bound by wood or metal hoops.
Traditionally, the barrel was also a standard size of measure referring to a set capacity or weight of a given commodity.
For example, in the UK a barrel of beer refers to a quantity of 36 imperial gallons (160 L; 43 US gal).
Wine was shipped in barrels of 119 litres (31 US gal; 26 imp gal).
Barrel has also come into use as a generic term for a wooden cask of any size.
Modern wooden barrels for wine-making are either made of French common oak ( Quercus robur ) and white oak ( Quercus petraea ) or from American white oak ( Quercus alba ) and typically have standard sizes: Bordeaux type 225 litres (59 US gal; 49 imp gal), Burgundy type 228 litres (60 US gal; 50 imp gal) and Cognac type 300 litres (79 US gal; 66 imp gal).
Modern barrels and casks can also be made of aluminum, stainless steel, and different types of plastic , such as HDPE .
Someone who makes barrels is called a barrel maker or cooper .
Barrels are only one type of cooperage.
Other types include, but are not limited to, the making of buckets , vats, tubs , butter churns , hogsheads , firkins , kegs , kilderkins, tierces , rundlets , puncheons , pipes, tuns , butts , pins, troughs and breakers.
Barrels have a variety of uses, including storage of liquids such as water and oil, fermenting wine , arrack , and sake , and maturing beverages such as wine , cognac , armagnac , sherry , port , whiskey , and beer .
Other commodities once stored in wooden casks include gunpowder , meat , fish, paint, nails and tallow .
Early casks were bound with wooden hoops and in the 19th century these were gradually replaced by metal hoops that were stronger, more durable and took up less space.
The term barrel can also refer to roughly cylindrical containers made of modern materials like plastic or steel.
A brothel , bordello , or whorehouse is a place where people engage in sexual activity with prostitutes .
Technically, any premises where prostitution commonly takes place qualifies as a brothel.
However, for legal or cultural reasons, establishments often describe themselves as massage parlors , bars , strip clubs , body rub parlours, studios, or by some other description.
Sex work in a brothel is considered safer than street prostitution .
A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases energy as heat energy or to be used for work .
The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion ).
The heat energy released by reactions of fuels is converted into mechanical energy via a heat engine .
Other times the heat itself is valued for warmth, cooking , or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that comes with combustion .
Fuels are also used in the cells of organisms in a process known as cellular respiration , where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy.
Hydrocarbons and related oxygen-containing molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized.
Fuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release electrical energy (such as batteries and capacitors ) or mechanical energy (such as flywheels , springs, compressed air, or water in a reservoir).
In geometry , a square is a regular quadrilateral , which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90- degree angles, or (100- gradian angles or right angles ).
It can also be defined as a rectangle in which two adjacent sides have equal length.
A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted ◻ {\\displaystyle \\square } ABCD .
A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed to transport cargo .
Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration; smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some automobiles .
Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to be mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of refuse trucks , fire trucks , concrete mixers , and suction excavators .
In American English, a commercial vehicle without a tractor or other articulation is formally a straight truck while one designed specifically to pull a trailer is not a truck but a tractor.
Modern trucks are largely powered by diesel engines , although small to medium size trucks with gasoline engines exist in the US, Canada, and Mexico.
In the European Union, vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to 3.5 t (7,700 lb) are known as light commercial vehicles , and those over as large goods vehicles .
The Zambezi (also spelled Zambeze and Zambesi ) is the fourth-longest river in Africa , the longest east-flowing river in Africa and the largest flowing into the Indian Ocean from Africa.
The area of its basin is 1,390,000 square kilometres (540,000 sq mi), slightly less than half of the Nile 's.
The 2,574-kilometre-long river (1,599 mi) arises in Zambia and flows through eastern Angola , along the north-eastern border of Namibia and the northern border of Botswana , then along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe to Mozambique , where it crosses the country to empty into the Indian Ocean .
The Zambezi's most noted feature is Victoria Falls .
Other notable falls include the Chavuma Falls at the border between Zambia and Angola, and Ngonye Falls , near Sioma in Western Zambia.
There are two main sources of hydroelectric power on the river, the Kariba Dam , which provides power to Zambia and Zimbabwe , and the Cahora Bassa Dam in Mozambique, which provides power to Mozambique and South Africa .
There are additional two smaller power stations along the Zambezi River in Zambia, one at Victoria Falls and the other one near Kalene Hill in Ikelenge District .
A valley is a low area between hills or mountains typically with a river running through it.
In geology , a valley or dale is a depression that is longer than it is wide.
The terms U-shaped and V-shaped are descriptive terms of geography to characterize the form of valleys.
Most valleys belong to one of these two main types or a mixture of them, at least with respect to the cross section of the slopes or hillsides.
Gates may refer to:
A test or examination (informally, exam or evaluation ) is an assessment intended to measure a test-taker's knowledge , skill , aptitude , physical fitness , or classification in many other topics (e.g., beliefs ).
A test may be administered verbally, on paper, on a computer , or in a predetermined area that requires a test taker to demonstrate or perform a set of skills.
Tests vary in style, rigor and requirements.
For example, in a closed book test, a test taker is usually required to rely upon memory to respond to specific items whereas in an open book test, a test taker may use one or more supplementary tools such as a reference book or calculator when responding.
A test may be administered formally or informally.
An example of an informal test would be a reading test administered by a parent to a child.
A formal test might be a final examination administered by a teacher in a classroom or an I.Q. test administered by a psychologist in a clinic.
Formal testing often results in a grade or a test score .
A test score may be interpreted with regards to a norm or criterion , or occasionally both.
The norm may be established independently, or by statistical analysis of a large number of participants.
An exam is meant to test a persons knowledge or willingness to give time to manipulate that subject.
A standardized test is any test that is administered and scored in a consistent manner to ensure legal defensibility.
Standardized tests are often used in education , professional certification , psychology (e.g., MMPI ), the military , and many other fields.
A non-standardized test is usually flexible in scope and format, variable in difficulty and significance.
Since these tests are usually developed by individual instructors, the format and difficulty of these tests may not be widely adopted or used by other instructors or institutions.
A non-standardized test may be used to determine the proficiency level of students, to motivate students to study, and to provide feedback to students.
In some instances, a teacher may develop non-standardized tests that resemble standardized tests in scope, format, and difficulty for the purpose of preparing their students for an upcoming standardized test.
Finally, the frequency and setting by which a non-standardized tests are administered are highly variable and are usually constrained by the duration of the class period.
A class instructor may for example, administer a test on a weekly basis or just twice a semester.
Depending on the policy of the instructor or institution, the duration of each test itself may last for only five minutes to an entire class period.
In contrasts to non-standardized tests, standardized tests are widely used, fixed in terms of scope, difficulty and format, and are usually significant in consequences.
Standardized tests are usually held on fixed dates as determined by the test developer, educational institution, or governing body, which may or may not be administered by the instructor, held within the classroom, or constrained by the classroom period.
Although there is little variability between different copies of the same type of standardized test (e.g., SAT or GRE ), there is variability between different types of standardized tests.
Any test with important consequences for the individual test taker is referred to as a high-stakes test .
A test may be developed and administered by an instructor, a clinician, a governing body, or a test provider.
In some instances, the developer of the test may not be directly responsible for its administration.
For example, Educational Testing Service (ETS), a nonprofit educational testing and assessment organization, develops standardized tests such as the SAT but may not directly be involved in the administration or proctoring of these tests.
As with the development and administration of educational tests, the format and level of difficulty of the tests themselves are highly variable and there is no general consensus or invariable standard for test formats and difficulty.
Often, the format and difficulty of the test is dependent upon the educational philosophy of the instructor, subject matter, class size, policy of the educational institution, and requirements of accreditation or governing bodies.
In general, tests developed and administered by individual instructors are non-standardized whereas tests developed by testing organizations are standardized.
A highway is any public or private road or other public way on land.
It is used for major roads, but also includes other public roads and public tracks: It is not an equivalent term to controlled-access highway , or a translation for autobahn , autoroute , etc.
According to Merriam Webster , the use of the term predates 12th century.
According to Etymonline , high is in the sense of main.
In North American and Australian English , major roads such as controlled-access highways or arterial roads are often state highways (Canada: provincial highways ).
Other roads may be designated county highways in the US and Ontario .
These classifications refer to the level of government (state, provincial, county) that maintains the roadway.
In British English , highway is primarily a legal term.
Everyday use normally implies roads, while the legal use covers any route or path with a public right of access, including footpaths etc.
The term has led to several related derived terms, including highway system , highway code , highway patrol and highwayman .
A cubicle is a partially enclosed office workspace that is separated from neighboring workspaces by partitions that are usually 5–6 feet (1.5–1.8 m) tall.
Its purpose is to isolate office workers and managers from the sights and noises of an open workspace so that they may concentrate with fewer distractions.
Cubicles are composed of modular elements such as walls, work surfaces, overhead bins, drawers, and shelving, which can be configured depending on the user's needs.
Installation is generally performed by trained personnel, although some cubicles allow configuration changes to be performed by users without specific training.
Cubicles in the 2010s are usually equipped with a computer, monitor, keyboard and mouse on the work surface.
Cubicles typically have a desk phone.
Since many offices use overhead fluorescent lights to illuminate the office, cubicles may or may not have lamps or other additional lighting.
Other furniture that is often used in cubicles includes an office chair, a filing cabinet for locking documents away, a bookcase and a coatrack.
The office cubicle was created by designer Robert Propst for Herman Miller , and released in 1967 under the name Action Office II.
Although cubicles are often seen as being symbolic of work in a modern office setting due to their uniformity and blandness, they afford the employee a greater degree of privacy and personalization than in previous work environments, which often consisted of desks lined up in rows within an open room.
They do so at a lower cost than individual, private offices.
In some office cubicle workspaces, employees can decorate the walls of their cubicle with posters, pictures and other items.
Tall commonly refers to:
Tall may also refer to:
Perception (from the Latin perceptio ) is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the presented information, or the environment.
All perception involves signals that go through the nervous system , which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the sensory system .
For example, vision involves light striking the retina of the eye , smell is mediated by odor molecules , and hearing involves pressure waves .
Perception is not only the passive receipt of these signals, but it's also shaped by the recipient's learning , memory , expectation , and attention .
Perception can be split into two processes,
Perception depends on complex functions of the nervous system, but subjectively seems mostly effortless because this processing happens outside conscious awareness.
Since the rise of experimental psychology in the 19th century, psychology's understanding of perception has progressed by combining a variety of techniques.
Psychophysics quantitatively describes the relationships between the physical qualities of the sensory input and perception.
Sensory neuroscience studies the neural mechanisms underlying perception.
Perceptual systems can also be studied computationally , in terms of the information they process.
Perceptual issues in philosophy include the extent to which sensory qualities such as sound, smell or color exist in objective reality rather than in the mind of the perceiver.
Although the senses were traditionally viewed as passive receptors, the study of illusions and ambiguous images has demonstrated that the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously attempt to make sense of their input.
There is still active debate about the extent to which perception is an active process of hypothesis testing, analogous to science , or whether realistic sensory information is rich enough to make this process unnecessary.
The perceptual systems of the brain enable individuals to see the world around them as stable, even though the sensory information is typically incomplete and rapidly varying.
Human and animal brains are structured in a modular way , with different areas processing different kinds of sensory information.
Some of these modules take the form of sensory maps , mapping some aspect of the world across part of the brain's surface.
These different modules are interconnected and influence each other.
For instance, taste is strongly influenced by smell.
The visual arts are art forms such as painting , drawing , printmaking , sculpture , ceramics , photography , video , filmmaking , design , crafts , and architecture .
Many artistic disciplines ( performing arts , conceptual art , textile arts ) involve aspects of the visual arts as well as arts of other types.
Also included within the visual arts are the applied arts such as industrial design , graphic design , fashion design , interior design and decorative art .
Current usage of the term visual arts includes fine art as well as the applied or decorative arts and crafts , but this was not always the case.
Before the Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain and elsewhere at the turn of the 20th century, the term 'artist' had for some centuries often been restricted to a person working in the fine arts (such as painting, sculpture, or printmaking) and not the decorative arts, craft, or applied art media.
The distinction was emphasized by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement, who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms.
Art schools made a distinction between the fine arts and the crafts, maintaining that a craftsperson could not be considered a practitioner of the arts.
The increasing tendency to privilege painting, and to a lesser degree sculpture, above other arts has been a feature of Western art as well as East Asian art.
In both regions painting has been seen as relying to the highest degree on the imagination of the artist, and the furthest removed from manual labour – in Chinese painting the most highly valued styles were those of scholar-painting, at least in theory practiced by gentleman amateurs.
The Western hierarchy of genres reflected similar attitudes.
Witchcraft (or witchery ) is the practice of magical skills and abilities.
Witchcraft is a broad term that varies culturally and societally, and thus can be difficult to define with precision, therefore cross-cultural assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution.
Historically, and in most traditional cultures worldwide - notably in Africa and in traditional Native American communities - the term is commonly associated with those who use metaphysical means to cause harm to the innocent.
In the modern era, especially among younger, urban and white peoples in America and Europe, the word may more commonly refer to benign or positive practices of modern paganism , where it may refer to a divinatory or healing role.
Belief in witchcraft is often present within societies and groups whose cultural framework includes a magical world view .
Prejudice is an affective feeling towards a person or group member based often on that person's group membership (tribal behavior).
The word is often used to refer to preconceived, usually unfavourable, feelings towards people or a person because of their political affiliation , sex , gender , beliefs , values , social class , age , disability , religion , sexuality , race / ethnicity , language , nationality , beauty , occupation , education , criminality , sport team affiliation or other personal characteristics.
In this case, it refers to a positive or negative evaluation of another person based on that person's perceived group membership.
Prejudice can also refer to unfounded or pigeonholed beliefs and it may include any unreasonable attitude that is unusually resistant to rational influence.
Gordon Allport defined prejudice as a feeling, favorable or unfavorable, toward a person or thing, prior to, or not based on, actual experience.
For the evolutionary psychology perspective, see Prejudice from an evolutionary perspective .
Auestad (2015) defines prejudice as characterized by 'symbolic transfer', transfer of a value-laden meaning content onto a socially formed category and then on to individuals who are taken to belong to that category, resistance to change, and overgeneralization.
Prejudice can also be classified as a reaction to a race and/or culture based purely on experience.
In electronics and telecommunications a transmitter or radio transmitter is an electronic device which produces radio waves with an antenna .
The transmitter itself generates a radio frequency alternating current , which is applied to the antenna .
When excited by this alternating current, the antenna radiates radio waves.
Transmitters are necessary component parts of all electronic devices that communicate by radio , such as radio and television broadcasting stations, cell phones , walkie-talkies , wireless computer networks , Bluetooth enabled devices, garage door openers , two-way radios in aircraft, ships, spacecraft, radar sets and navigational beacons.
The term transmitter is usually limited to equipment that generates radio waves for communication purposes; or radiolocation , such as radar and navigational transmitters.
Generators of radio waves for heating or industrial purposes, such as microwave ovens or diathermy equipment, are not usually called transmitters, even though they often have similar circuits.
The term is popularly used more specifically to refer to a broadcast transmitter , a transmitter used in broadcasting , as in FM radio transmitter or television transmitter .
This usage typically includes both the transmitter proper, the antenna, and often the building it is housed in.
An awning or overhang is a secondary covering attached to the exterior wall of a building.
It is typically composed of canvas woven of acrylic , cotton or polyester yarn, or vinyl laminated to polyester fabric that is stretched tightly over a light structure of aluminium , iron or steel , possibly wood or transparent material (used to cover solar thermal panels in the summer, but that must allow as much light as possible in the winter).
The configuration of this structure is something of a truss , space frame or planar frame .
Awnings are also often constructed of aluminium understucture with aluminium sheeting .
These aluminium awnings are often used when a fabric awning is not a practical application where snow load as well as wind loads may be a factor.
The location of an awning on a building may be above a window , a door , or above the area along a sidewalk .
With the addition of columns an awning becomes a canopy , which is able to extend further from a building, as in the case of an entrance to a hotel .
Restaurants often use awnings broad enough to cover substantial outdoor area for outdoor dining, parties, or reception.
In commercial buildings, an awning is often painted with information as to the name , business , and address , thus acting as a sign or billboard as well as providing shade, breaking strong winds , and protecting from rain or snow.
In areas with wintry weather, most awnings do not have to be taken down at the end of the summer – they can remain retracted against the building all winter long, or be designed and built for those conditions.
Injury , also known as physical trauma , is damage to the body caused by external force.
This may be caused by accidents, falls, hits, weapons, and other causes.
Major trauma is injury that has the potential to cause prolonged disability or death .
In 2013, 4.8 million people world-wide died from injuries, up from 4.3 million in 1990.
More than 30% of these deaths were transport-related injuries.
In 2013, 367,000 children under the age of five died from injuries, down from 766,000 in 1990.
Injuries are the cause of 9% of all deaths, and are the sixth-leading cause of death in the world.
Hippos ( Ancient Greek : Ἵππος , horse) is an archaeological site in Israel , located on a hill overlooking the Sea of Galilee .
Between the 3rd century BC and the 7th century CE, Hippos was the site of a Greco-Roman city, which declined under Muslim rule and was abandoned after an earthquake in 749 .
Besides the fortified city itself, Hippos controlled two port facilities on the lake and an area of the surrounding countryside.
Hippos was part of the Decapolis , or Ten Cities, a region in Roman Jordan, Syria and Israel that were culturally tied more closely to Greece and Rome than to the Semitic ethnoi around.
Established as Antioch of Hippos ( Ἀντιόχεια τοῦ Ἵππου ) by Seleucid settlers, the city is named after the Greek language word for horse, Hippos , and a common name of Seleucid monarchs, Antiochus .
In the 3rd-century Mosaic of Rehob , the site is known by its Aramaic name, Sussita ( Hebrew : סוסיתא ‎), a word meaning horse in the feminine gender, while the Arabic name, Qal'at al-Hisn or Husn , has been used by the country's Arab inhabitants, meaning, Fortress of the Horse/Stallion.
Other names include the alternate spelling Hippus and the Latinized version of the Greek name: Hippum .
The precise reason why the city received this name is unknown.
A basement or cellar is one or more floors of a building that are completely or partly below the ground floor .
It generally is used as a utility space for a building, where such items as the boiler , water heater , breaker panel or fuse box , car park , and air-conditioning system are located; so also are amenities such as the electrical distribution system and cable television distribution point.
In cities with high property prices, such as London , basements are often fitted out to a high standard and used as living space.
In British English , the word basement is used for underground floors of, for example, department stores, but the word is only used with houses when the space below the ground floor is habitable, with windows and (usually) its own access.
The word cellar applies to the whole underground level or to any large underground room.
A subcellar is a cellar that lies further underneath.
A village is a part of a world clustered human settlement or community , larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town , with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand.
Though villages are often located in rural areas , the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighborhoods.
Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings ; however, transient villages can occur.
Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement .
In the past, villages were a usual form of community for societies that practice subsistence agriculture , and also for some non-agricultural societies.
In Great Britain, a hamlet earned the right to be called a village when it built a church.
In many cultures, towns and cities were few, with only a small proportion of the population living in them.
The Industrial Revolution attracted people in larger numbers to work in mills and factories; the concentration of people caused many villages to grow into towns and cities.
This also enabled specialization of labor and crafts, and development of many trades.
The trend of urbanization continues, though not always in connection with industrialization.
Although many patterns of village life have existed, the typical village is often small, consisting of perhaps 5 to 30 families.
Historically homes were situated together for sociability and defence, and land surrounding the living quarters was farmed.
Traditional fishing villages were based on artisan fishing and located adjacent to fishing grounds.
Dollar (often represented by the dollar sign $ ) is the name of more than 20 currencies , including those of Australia , Canada , Hong Kong , Jamaica , Liberia , Namibia , New Zealand , Singapore , Taiwan , and the United States .
The U.S. dollar is also the official currency of the Caribbean Netherlands , East Timor , Ecuador , El Salvador , the Federated States of Micronesia , the Marshall Islands , Palau , and Zimbabwe .
One dollar is generally divided into 100 cents .
A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed to transport cargo .
Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration; smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some automobiles .
Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to be mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of refuse trucks , fire trucks , concrete mixers , and suction excavators .
In American English, a commercial vehicle without a tractor or other articulation is formally a straight truck while one designed specifically to pull a trailer is not a truck but a tractor.
Modern trucks are largely powered by diesel engines , although small to medium size trucks with gasoline engines exist in the US, Canada, and Mexico.
In the European Union, vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to 3.5 t (7,700 lb) are known as light commercial vehicles , and those over as large goods vehicles .
A wall is a structure that defines an area, carries a load; provides security, shelter, or soundproofing; or is decorative.
There are many kinds of walls, including:
Honda Motor Company, Ltd.
( Japanese : 本田技研工業株式会社 , Hepburn : Honda Giken Kōgyō KK , IPA: honda ( listen ) ; ) is a Japanese public multinational conglomerate corporation primarily known as a manufacturer of automobiles, motorcycles, and power equipment.
Honda has been the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer since 1959, as well as the world's largest manufacturer of internal combustion engines measured by volume, producing more than 14 million internal combustion engines each year.
Honda became the second-largest Japanese automobile manufacturer in 2001.
Honda was the eighth largest automobile manufacturer in the world in 2015.
Honda was the first Japanese automobile manufacturer to release a dedicated luxury brand, Acura , in 1986.
Aside from their core automobile and motorcycle businesses, Honda also manufactures garden equipment, marine engines, personal watercraft and power generators, and other products.
Since 1986, Honda has been involved with artificial intelligence/robotics research and released their ASIMO robot in 2000.
They have also ventured into aerospace with the establishment of GE Honda Aero Engines in 2004 and the Honda HA-420 HondaJet , which began production in 2012.
Honda has three joint-ventures in China ( Honda China , Dongfeng Honda , and Guangqi Honda ).
In 2013, Honda invested about 5.7% (US$6.8 billion) of its revenues in research and development.
Also in 2013, Honda became the first Japanese automaker to be a net exporter from the United States, exporting 108,705 Honda and Acura models, while importing only 88,357.
A restaurant ( French: ʁɛstoʁɑ̃ ( listen ) ), or an eatery , is a business which prepares and serves food and drinks to customers in exchange for money .
Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises , but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services .
Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias , to mid-priced family restaurants , to high-priced luxury establishments.
In Western countries, most mid- to high-range restaurants serve alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine .
Some restaurants serve all the major meals, such as breakfast , lunch , and dinner (e.g., major fast food chains, diners, hotel restaurants, and airport restaurants).
Other restaurants may serve only a single meal (for example, a pancake house may only serve breakfast) or they may serve two meals (e.g., lunch and dinner).
A diplomatic mission or foreign mission is a group of people from one state or an organisation present in another state to represent the sending state/organisation officially in the receiving state.
In practice, the phrase diplomatic mission usually denotes the resident mission, namely the embassy , which is the main office of a country's diplomatic representatives to another country; this is usually, but not necessarily, in the receiving state's capital city.
Consulates , on the other hand, are smaller diplomatic missions which are normally located in major cities of the receiving state (but can be located in the capital, usually when the sending country has no embassy in the receiving state).
As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries.
There are thus resident and non-resident embassies.
In physics , a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object .
A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest ), i.e., to accelerate .
Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull.
A force has both magnitude and direction , making it a vector quantity.
It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F .
The original form of Newton's second law states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes with time.
If the mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
Concepts related to force include: thrust , which increases the velocity of an object; drag , which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque , which produces changes in rotational speed of an object.
In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress .
Such internal mechanical stresses cause no acceleration of that body as the forces balance one another.
Pressure , the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate.
Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids .
Berlin ( , German: bɛɐ̯ˈliːn ( listen ) ) is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population.
Its 3,748,148 (2018) inhabitants make it the second most populous city proper of the European Union after London .
The city is one of Germany's 16 federal states .
It is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg , and contiguous with its capital, Potsdam .
The two cities are at the center of the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region , which is, with about six million inhabitants and an area of more than 30,000 km², Germany's third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions.
Berlin straddles the banks of the River Spree , which flows into the River Havel (a tributary of the River Elbe ) in the western borough of Spandau .
Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel, and Dahme rivers (the largest of which is Lake Müggelsee ).
Due to its location in the European Plain , Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate.
About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes.
The city lies in the Central German dialect area, the Berlin dialect being a variant of the Lusatian-New Marchian dialects .
First documented in the 13th century and situated at the crossing of two important historic trade routes , Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417–1701), the Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1918), the German Empire (1871–1918), the Weimar Republic (1919–1933), and the Third Reich (1933–1945).
Berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in the world.
After World War II and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the city was divided; West Berlin became a de facto West German exclave , surrounded by the Berlin Wall (1961–1989) and East German territory.
East Berlin was declared capital of East Germany , while Bonn became the West German capital.
Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany.
Berlin is a world city of culture, politics, media and science.
Its economy is based on high-tech firms and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries , research facilities, media corporations and convention venues.
Berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a highly complex public transportation network.
The metropolis is a popular tourist destination .
Significant industries also include IT , pharmaceuticals, biomedical engineering, clean tech, biotechnology , construction and electronics.
Berlin is home to world-renowned universities, orchestras, museums, and entertainment venues, and is host to many sporting events.
Its Zoological Garden is the most visited zoo in Europe and one of the most popular worldwide.
With the world's oldest large-scale movie studio complex , Berlin is an increasingly popular location for international film productions .
The city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture, nightlife, contemporary arts and a very high quality of living .
Since the 2000s Berlin has seen the emergence of a cosmopolitan entrepreneurial scene .

The tomato is the edible, often red, berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum , commonly known as a tomato plant.
The species originated in western South America and Central America .
The Nahuatl (Aztec language) word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate , from which the English word tomato derived.
Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico .
The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire , and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs , they brought the plant to Europe.
From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.
Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor.
The tomato is consumed in diverse ways, raw or cooked, in many dishes, sauces, salads , and drinks.
While tomatoes are fruits — botanically classified as berries —they are commonly used as a vegetable ingredient or side dish .
Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year.
Tomato plants typically grow to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) in height.
They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support.
Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, but are cultivated as annuals .
Determinate, or bush, plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once.
The size of the tomato varies according to the cultivar , with a range of 0.5–4 inches (1.3–10.2 cm) in width.
A kiss is the touch or pressing of one's lips against another person or an object.
Cultural connotations of kissing vary widely.
Depending on the culture and context, a kiss can express sentiments of love , passion , romance , sexual attraction , sexual activity , sexual arousal , affection , respect , greeting , friendship , peace , and good luck, among many others.
In some situations, a kiss is a ritual, formal or symbolic gesture indicating devotion, respect, or sacrament .
The word came from Old English cyssan ( to kiss ), in turn from coss (a kiss).
A miner is a person who extracts ore , coal , or other mineral from the earth through mining .
There are two senses in which the term is used.
In its narrowest sense, a miner is someone who works at the rock face ; cutting, blasting, or otherwise working and removing the rock.
In a broader sense, a miner is anyone working within a mine, not just a worker at the rock face.
Mining is one of the most dangerous trades in the world.
In some countries, miners lack social guarantees and in case of injury may be left to cope without assistance.
In regions with a long mining tradition, many communities have developed cultural traditions and aspects specific to the various regions, in the forms of particular equipment, symbolism, music, and the like.
Plants are mainly multicellular , predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae .
Historically, plants were treated as one of two kingdoms including all living things that were not animals , and all algae and fungi were treated as plants.
However, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria ).
By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for green plants), a group that includes the flowering plants , conifers and other gymnosperms , ferns and their allies , hornworts , liverworts , mosses and the green algae , but excludes the red and brown algae .
Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria .
Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color.
Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize.
Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations , although asexual reproduction is also common.
There are about 320 thousand species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260–290 thousand, are seed plants (see the table below ).
Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems, especially on land.
Plants that produce grain , fruit and vegetables form humankind's basic foods, and have been domesticated for millennia.
Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials , writing material and, in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs .
The scientific study of plants is known as botany , a branch of biology .
Dance is a performing art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement .
This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture .
Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography , by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin .
An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance, although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social , ceremonial , competitive , erotic , martial , or sacred / liturgical .
Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts , gymnastics , cheerleading , figure skating , synchronized swimming , marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.
October is the tenth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars and the sixth of seven months to have a length of 31 days .
The eighth month in the old calendar of Romulus c.
750 BC , October retained its name (from the Latin ôctō meaning eight) after January and February were inserted into the calendar that had originally been created by the Romans.
In Ancient Rome , one of three Mundus patet would take place on October 5, Meditrinalia October 11, Augustalia on October 12, October Horse on October 15, and Armilustrium on October 19.
These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.
Among the Anglo-Saxons , it was known as Ƿinterfylleþ , because at this full moon ( fylleþ ) winter was supposed to begin.
October is commonly associated with the season of autumn in the Northern hemisphere and with spring in the Southern hemisphere .
In mathematics , an equation is a statement that asserts the equality of two expressions.
The word equation and its cognates in other languages may have subtly different meanings; for example, in French an équation is defined as containing one or more variables , while in English any equality is an equation.
Solving an equation containing variables consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true.
Variables are also called unknowns and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation.
There are two kinds of equations: identities and conditional equations.
An identity is true for all values of the variable.
A conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables.
An equation is written as two expressions , connected by a equals sign (=).
The expressions on the two sides of the equals sign are called the left-hand side and right-hand side of the equation.
The most common type of equation is an algebraic equation , in which the two sides are algebraic expressions .Each side of an algebraic equation will contain one or more terms .
For example, the equation
has left-hand side A x 2 + B x + C {\\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C} , which has three terms, and right-hand side y {\\displaystyle y} , consisting of just one term.
The unknowns are x and y and the parameters are A , B , and C .
An equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed.
When equal weights of something (grain for example) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal.
If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance.
Likewise, to keep an equation in balance, the same operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division must be performed on both sides of an equation for it to remain true.
In geometry , equations are used to describe geometric figures .
As the equations that are considered, such as implicit equations or parametric equations , have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures.
This is the starting idea of algebraic geometry , an important area of mathematics.
Algebra studies two main families of equations: polynomial equations and, among them, the special case of linear equations .
When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form P ( x ) = 0, where P is a polynomial , and linear equations have the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are parameters .
To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis .
Algebra also studies Diophantine equations where the coefficients and solutions are integers .
The techniques used are different and come from number theory .
These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions.
Differential equations are equations that involve one or more functions and their derivatives.
They are solved by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives.
Differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.
The = symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde , who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.
An officer is a person who has a position of authority in a hierarchical organization.
The term derives from the late Latin from officiarius , meaning official .
A diplomatic mission or foreign mission is a group of people from one state or an organisation present in another state to represent the sending state/organisation officially in the receiving state.
In practice, the phrase diplomatic mission usually denotes the resident mission, namely the embassy , which is the main office of a country's diplomatic representatives to another country; this is usually, but not necessarily, in the receiving state's capital city.
Consulates , on the other hand, are smaller diplomatic missions which are normally located in major cities of the receiving state (but can be located in the capital, usually when the sending country has no embassy in the receiving state).
As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries.
There are thus resident and non-resident embassies.
An icon (from the Greek εἰκών eikōn image, resemblance) is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting , in the cultures of the Eastern Orthodox Church , Oriental Orthodoxy , the Roman Catholic , and certain Eastern Catholic churches.
The most common subjects include Christ , Mary , saints and angels .
Although especially associated with portrait style images concentrating on one or two main figures, the term also covers most religious images in a variety of artistic media produced by Eastern Christianity , including narrative scenes.
Icons can represent various scenes in the Bible.
Icons may also be cast in metal, carved in stone, embroidered on cloth, painted on wood, done in mosaic or fresco work, printed on paper or metal, etc.
Comparable images from Western Christianity are generally not classified as icons, although iconic may be used to describe a static style of devotional image.
Eastern Orthodox tradition holds that the production of Christian images dates back to the very early days of Christianity , and that it has been a continuous tradition since then.
Modern academic art history considers that, while images may have existed earlier, the tradition can be traced back only as far as the 3rd century, and that the images which survive from Early Christian art often differ greatly from later ones.
The icons of later centuries can be linked, often closely, to images from the 5th century onwards, though very few of these survive.
Widespread destruction of images occurred during the Byzantine Iconoclasm of 726–842, although this did settle permanently the question of the appropriateness of images.
Since then icons have had a great continuity of style and subject; far greater than in the images of the Western church .
At the same time there has been change and development.
A lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin , that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake.
Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean , and therefore are distinct from lagoons , and are also larger and deeper than ponds , though there are no official or scientific definitions.
Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams , which are usually flowing.
Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.
Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones , and areas with ongoing glaciation .
Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers.
In some parts of the world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age .
All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.
Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydro-electric power generation or domestic water supply, or for aesthetic, recreational purposes, or other activities.
Temperature is a physical quantity expressing hot and cold.
It is measured with a thermometer calibrated in one or more temperature scales .
The most commonly used scales are the Celsius scale (formerly called centigrade ) (denoted °C), Fahrenheit scale (denoted °F), and Kelvin scale (denoted K).
The kelvin (the word is spelled with a lower-case k) is the unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI).
The Kelvin scale is widely used in science and technology .
Theoretically, the coldest a system can be is when its temperature is absolute zero , at which point the thermal motion in matter would be zero.
However, an actual physical system or object can never attain a temperature of absolute zero.
Absolute zero is denoted as 0 K on the Kelvin scale, −273.15 °C on the Celsius scale, and −459.67 °F on the Fahrenheit scale.
For an ideal gas , temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the random microscopic motions of the constituent microscopic particles.
This is now the basis of the definition of the magnitude of the kelvin.
Temperature is important in all fields of natural science , including physics , chemistry , Earth science , medicine , and biology , as well as most aspects of daily life.
Race , RACE or The Race may refer to:
Culture ( ) is the social behavior and norms found in human societies .
The uterus (from Latin uterus, plural uteri ) or womb is a major female hormone-responsive secondary sex organ of the reproductive system in humans and most other mammals .
In the human, the lower end of the uterus, the cervix , opens into the vagina , while the upper end, the fundus, is connected to the fallopian tubes .
It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation .
In the human embryo , the uterus develops from the paramesonephric ducts which fuse into the single organ known as a simplex uterus.
The uterus has different forms in many other animals and in some it exists as two separate uteri known as a duplex uterus .
In English, the term uterus is used consistently within the medical and related professions, while the Germanic -derived term womb is also commonly used in everyday contexts.
A village is a part of a world clustered human settlement or community , larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town , with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand.
Though villages are often located in rural areas , the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighborhoods.
Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings ; however, transient villages can occur.
Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement .
In the past, villages were a usual form of community for societies that practice subsistence agriculture , and also for some non-agricultural societies.
In Great Britain, a hamlet earned the right to be called a village when it built a church.
In many cultures, towns and cities were few, with only a small proportion of the population living in them.
The Industrial Revolution attracted people in larger numbers to work in mills and factories; the concentration of people caused many villages to grow into towns and cities.
This also enabled specialization of labor and crafts, and development of many trades.
The trend of urbanization continues, though not always in connection with industrialization.
Although many patterns of village life have existed, the typical village is often small, consisting of perhaps 5 to 30 families.
Historically homes were situated together for sociability and defence, and land surrounding the living quarters was farmed.
Traditional fishing villages were based on artisan fishing and located adjacent to fishing grounds.
An episode is a coherent narrative unit within a larger dramatic work, such as a radio or television series .
The word derives from the Greek term ( Ancient Greek : ἐπεισόδιον ) ( epeisodion ), meaning the material contained between two songs or odes in a Greek tragedy .
A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of part or all of an organism, and that is not due to any external injury.
Diseases are often construed as medical conditions that are associated with specific symptoms and signs .
A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions.
For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency , hypersensitivity , allergies and autoimmune disorders .
In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain , dysfunction , distress , social problems , or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person.
In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries , disabilities , disorders , syndromes , infections , isolated symptoms , deviant behaviors , and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories.
Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life.
Death due to disease is called death by natural causes .
There are four main types of disease: infectious diseases , deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases ), and physiological diseases.
Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as communicable versus non-communicable diseases.
The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections .
In developed countries, the diseases that cause the most sickness overall are neuropsychiatric conditions , such as depression and anxiety .
The study of disease is called pathology , which includes the study of etiology , or cause.
Divide may refer to:
Memory is the faculty of the brain by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed.
It is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action.
If past events could not be remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, or personal identity to develop.
Memory loss is usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia .
Memory is often understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a sensory processor , short-term (or working ) memory, and long-term memory .
This can be related to the neuron .The sensory processor allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli and attended to various levels of focus and intent.
Working memory serves as an encoding and retrieval processor.
Information in the form of stimuli is encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions by the working memory processor.
The working memory also retrieves information from previously stored material.
Finally, the function of long-term memory is to store data through various categorical models or systems.
Declarative, or explicit, memory is the conscious storage and recollection of data.
Under declarative memory resides semantic and episodic memory .
Semantic memory refers to memory that is encoded with specific meaning, while episodic memory refers to information that is encoded along a spatial and temporal plane.
Declarative memory is usually the primary process thought of when referencing memory.
Non-declarative, or implicit, memory is the unconscious storage and recollection of information.
An example of a non-declarative process would be the unconscious learning or retrieval of information by way of procedural memory , or a priming phenomenon.
Priming is the process of subliminally arousing specific responses from memory and shows that not all memory is consciously activated, whereas procedural memory is the slow and gradual learning of skills that often occurs without conscious attention to learning.
Memory is not a perfect processor, and is affected by many factors.
The ways by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved can all be corrupted.
The amount of attention given new stimuli can diminish the amount of information that becomes encoded for storage.
Also, the storage process can become corrupted by physical damage to areas of the brain that are associated with memory storage, such as the hippocampus.
Finally, the retrieval of information from long-term memory can be disrupted because of decay within long-term memory.
Normal functioning, decay over time, and brain damage all affect the accuracy and capacity of the memory.

In signal processing , a signal is a function that conveys information about a phenomenon.
In electronics and telecommunications, it refers to any time varying voltage , current or electromagnetic wave that carries information.
A signal may also be defined as an observable change in a quantity.
Any physical quantity that exhibits variation in space or time can be a signal used, among other possibilities, to share messages between observers.
According to the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing , a signal can be audio , video , speech, image , sonar and radar-related and so on.
In a later effort of redefining a signal, anything that is only a function of space, such as an image, is excluded from the category of signals.
Also, it is stated that a signal may or may not contain any information.
In nature, signals can be actions done by an organism to alert other organisms, ranging from the release of plant chemicals to warn nearby plants of a predator, to sounds or motions made by animals to alert other animals of food.
Signalling occurs in all organisms even at cellular levels, with cell signaling .
Signaling theory , in evolutionary biology, proposes that a substantial driver for evolution is the ability for animals to communicate with each other by developing ways of signaling.
In human engineering, signals are typically provided by a sensor , and often the original form of a signal is converted to another form of energy using a transducer .
For example, a microphone converts an acoustic signal to a voltage waveform, and a speaker does the reverse.
Information theory serves as the formal study of signals and their content, and the information of a signal is often accompanied by noise .
The term noise refers to unwanted signal modifications, but is often extended to include unwanted signals conflicting with desired signals (crosstalk ).
The reduction of noise is covered in part under the heading of signal integrity .
The separation of desired signals from background noise is the field of signal recovery , one branch of which is estimation theory , a probabilistic approach to suppressing random disturbances.
Engineering disciplines such as electrical engineering have led the way in the design, study, and implementation of systems involving transmission , storage , and manipulation of information .
In the latter half of the 20th century, electrical engineering itself separated into several disciplines, specialising in the design and analysis of systems that manipulate physical signals; electronic engineering and computer engineering as examples; while design engineering developed to deal with functional design of user–machine interfaces .

Samuel is a figure who, in the narratives of the Hebrew Bible , plays a key role in the transition from the period of the biblical judges to the institution of a kingdom under Saul , and again in the transition from Saul to David .
He is venerated as a prophet by Jews, Christians, and Muslims.
In addition to his role in the Hebrew Scriptures, Samuel is mentioned in the New Testament , in rabbinical literature , and in the second chapter of the Qur'an , although here not by name.
He is also treated in the fifth through seventh books of Josephus 's Antiquities of the Jews , written in the first century CE (AD).
He is first called the Seer in 1 Samuel 9:9.
Assassination is the act of killing a prominent person for either political, religious or monetary reasons.
An assassination may be prompted by religious, political or military motives .
It is an act that may be done for financial gain , to avenge a grievance, from a desire to acquire fame or notoriety , or because of a military, security, insurgent or secret police group's command to carry out the homicide .
Acts of assassination have been performed since ancient times .
A bed is a piece of furniture which is used as a place to sleep or relax .
Most modern beds consist of a soft, cushioned mattress on a bed frame , the mattress resting either on a solid base , often wood slats, or a sprung base.
Many beds include a box spring inner-sprung base , which is a large mattress-sized box containing wood and springs that provide additional support and suspension for the mattress.
Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized bassinets and cribs , to small beds for a single person or adult, to large queen and king-size beds designed for two people.
While most beds are single mattresses on a fixed frame, there are other varieties, such as the murphy bed , which folds into a wall, the sofa bed , which folds out of a sofa, and the bunk bed , which provides two mattresses on two tiers.
Temporary beds include the inflatable air mattress and the folding camp cot .
Some beds contain neither a padded mattress nor a bed frame, such as the hammock .
Some beds are made especially for animals .
Beds may have a headboard for resting against, and may have side rails and footboards (or footers).
Headboard only beds may incorporate a dust ruffle, bed skirt, or valance sheet to hide the bed frame.
To support the head, a pillow made of a soft, padded material is usually placed on the top of the mattress.
Some form of covering blanket is often used to insulate the sleeper, often bed sheets , a quilt , or a duvet , collectively referred to as bedding .
Bedding is the removable non-furniture portion of a bed, which enables these components to be washed or aired out.

Italy ( Italian : Italia iˈtaːlja ( listen ) ), officially the Italian Republic (Italian: Repubblica Italiana reˈpubblika itaˈljaːna ), is a European country consisting of a peninsula delimited by the Italian Alps and surrounded by several islands .
Located in the middle of the Mediterranean sea and traversed along its length by the Apennines , Italy has a largely temperate seasonal and Mediterranean climate .
The country covers a total area of 301,340 km (116,350 sq mi), and land area of 294,140 km (113,570 sq mi), and shares open land borders with France, Slovenia, Austria, Switzerland and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino .
Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ).
With around 60 million inhabitants, Italy is the fourth-most populous member state of the European Union .
Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures.
In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout modern-day Italy, the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name, beginning from the classical era, Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively.
An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC, which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People .
The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the peninsula, eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia .
By the first century BC, the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became the leading cultural, political and religious centre of Western civilisation , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed.
Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire, whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture, governments, Christianity and the Latin script .
During the Early Middle Ages , Italy endured sociopolitical collapse and barbarian invasions , but by the 11th century, numerous rival city-states and maritime republics , mainly in the northern and central regions of Italy, rose to great prosperity through trade, commerce and banking, laying the groundwork for modern capitalism .
These mostly independent statelets served as Europe's main trading hubs with Asia and the Near East, often enjoying a greater degree of democracy than the larger feudal monarchies that were consolidating throughout Europe; however, part of central Italy was under the control of the theocratic Papal States , while Southern Italy remained largely feudal until the 19th century, partially as a result of a succession of Byzantine , Arab , Norman , Angevin , Aragonese and other foreign conquests of the region.
The Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in humanism , science , exploration and art .
Italian culture flourished, producing famous scholars, artists and polymaths .
During the Middle Ages, Italian explorers discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World , helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery .
Nevertheless, Italy's commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes that bypassed the Mediterranean.
Furthermore, centuries of infighting between the Italian city-states, such as the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries, left the region fragmented, and it was subsequently conquered and further divided by European powers such as France , Spain and Austria .
By the mid-19th century, rising Italian nationalism and calls for independence from foreign control led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval.
After centuries of foreign domination and political division, Italy was almost entirely unified in 1861, establishing the Kingdom of Italy as a great power .
From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Italy rapidly industrialised, namely in the north, and acquired a colonial empire , while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation , fuelling a large and influential diaspora .
Despite being one of the main victors in World War I , Italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil, leading to the rise of a fascist dictatorship in 1922.
Participation in World War II on the Axis side ended in military defeat, economic destruction and the Italian Civil War .
Following the liberation of Italy and the rise of the resistance , the country abolished the monarchy , established a democratic Republic and enjoyed a prolonged economic boom , becoming a highly developed country .
Today, Italy is considered to be one of the world's most culturally and economically advanced countries, with its economy ranking eighth-largest in the world and third in the Eurozone by nominal GDP.
Italy has the sixth-largest worldwide national wealth , the third-largest central bank gold reserve , and a very high life expectancy .
The country plays a prominent role in regional and global economic, military, cultural and diplomatic affairs; it is both a regional power and a great power , and is ranked the world's eighth most-powerful military .
Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union and a member of numerous international institutions, including the UN , NATO , the OECD , the OSCE , the WTO , the G7 , the G20 , the Union for the Mediterranean , the Council of Europe , Uniting for Consensus , the Schengen Area and many more .
The country have greatly influenced and contributed to diverse fields, notably the arts , music , literature , philosophy , science and technology , fashion , cinema , cuisine , sports , as well as jurisprudence, banking and business.
As a reflection of its cultural wealth, Italy is home to the world's largest number of World Heritage Sites ( 54 ), and is the fifth-most visited country .
Emotion is a mental state associated with the nervous system brought on by chemical changes variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioural responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure .
There is currently no scientific consensus on a definition.
Emotion is often intertwined with mood , temperament , personality , disposition , and motivation .
Research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades with many fields contributing including psychology , neuroscience , endocrinology , medicine , history , sociology of emotions , and computer science .
The numerous theories that attempt to explain the origin, neurobiology, experience, and function of emotions have only fostered more intense research on this topic.
Current areas of research in the concept of emotion include the development of materials that stimulate and elicit emotion.
In addition PET scans and fMRI scans help study the affective picture processes in the brain.
Emotions can be defined as a positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity.
Emotions produce different physiological, behavioral and cognitive changes.
The original role of emotions was to motivate adaptive behaviors that in the past would have contributed to the passing on of genes through survival, reproduction, and kin selection.
In some theories, cognition is an important aspect of emotion.
Those acting primarily on the emotions they are feeling may seem as if they are not thinking, but mental processes are still essential, particularly in the interpretation of events.
For example, the realization of our believing that we are in a dangerous situation and the subsequent arousal of our body's nervous system (rapid heartbeat and breathing, sweating, muscle tension) is integral to the experience of our feeling afraid.
Other theories, however, claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition.
Consciously experiencing an emotion is exhibiting a mental representation of that emotion from a past or hypothetical experience, which is linked back to a content state of pleasure or displeasure.
The content states are established by verbal explanations of experiences, describing an internal state.
Emotions are complex.
According to some theories, they are states of feeling that result in physical and psychological changes that influence our behavior.
The physiology of emotion is closely linked to arousal of the nervous system with various states and strengths of arousal relating, apparently, to particular emotions.
Emotion is also linked to behavioral tendency.
Extroverted people are more likely to be social and express their emotions, while introverted people are more likely to be more socially withdrawn and conceal their emotions.
Emotion is often the driving force behind motivation , positive or negative.
According to other theories, emotions are not causal forces but simply syndromes of components, which might include motivation, feeling, behavior, and physiological changes, but no one of these components is the emotion.
Nor is the emotion an entity that causes these components.
Emotions involve different components, such as subjective experience, cognitive processes , expressive behavior, psychophysiological changes, and instrumental behavior.
At one time, academics attempted to identify the emotion with one of the components: William James with a subjective experience, behaviorists with instrumental behavior, psychophysiologists with physiological changes, and so on.
More recently, emotion is said to consist of all the components.
The different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline.
In psychology and philosophy , emotion typically includes a subjective , conscious experience characterized primarily by psychophysiological expressions , biological reactions , and mental states .
A similar multicomponential description of emotion is found in sociology .
For example, Peggy Thoits described emotions as involving physiological components, cultural or emotional labels (anger, surprise, etc.), expressive body actions, and the appraisal of situations and contexts.
A famine is a widespread scarcity of food , caused by several factors including war, inflation, crop failure , population imbalance , or government policies.
This phenomenon is usually accompanied or followed by regional malnutrition , starvation , epidemic , and increased mortality .
Every inhabited continent in the world has experienced a period of famine throughout history.
In the 19th and 20th century, it was generally Southeast and South Asia, as well as Eastern and Central Europe that suffered the most deaths from famine.
The numbers dying from famine began to fall sharply from the 2000s.
Some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa , continue to have extreme cases of famine.
Since 2010, Africa has been the most affected continent in the world.
As of 2017, the United Nations has warned some 20 million are at risk in South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Yemen .
The distribution of food has been affected by conflict.
Most programmes now direct their aid towards Africa.
Activism consists of efforts to promote, impede, direct, or intervene in social , political , economic , or environmental reform with the desire to make changes in society .
Forms of activism range from mandate building in the community (including writing letters to newspapers), petitioning elected officials , running or contributing to a political campaign, preferential patronage (or boycott ) of businesses, and demonstrative forms of activism like rallies , street marches , strikes , sit-ins , or hunger strikes .
Activism may be performed on a day-to-day basis in a wide variety of ways, including through the creation of art ( artivism ), computer hacking ( hacktivism ), or simply in how one chooses to spend their money ( economic activism ).
For example, the refusal to buy clothes or other merchandise from a company as a protest against the exploitation of workers by that company could be considered an expression of activism.
However, the most highly visible and impactful activism often comes in the form of collective action , in which numerous individuals coordinate an act of protest together in order to make a bigger impact.
Collective action that is purposeful, organized, and sustained over a period of time becomes known as a social movement .
Historically, activists have used literature, including pamphlets , tracts, and books to disseminate their messages and attempt to persuade their readers of the justice of their cause.
Research has now begun to explore how contemporary activist groups use social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action combining politics with technology .
The Online Etymology Dictionary records the English words activism and activist as in use in the political sense from the year 1920 or 1915 respectively.
A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebrate skeleton .
Bones protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells , store minerals , provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility .
Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure.
They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple functions .
Bone tissue (osseous tissue) is a hard tissue , a type of dense connective tissue .
It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity.
Bone tissue is made up of different types of bone cells .
Osteoblasts and osteocytes are involved in the formation and mineralization of bone; osteoclasts are involved in the resorption of bone tissue.
Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface.
The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly collagen called ossein and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts.
Bone tissue is a mineralized tissue of two types, cortical bone and cancellous bone .
Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow , endosteum , periosteum , nerves , blood vessels and cartilage .
In the human body at birth, there are over 300 bones, but many of these fuse together during development, leaving a total of 206 separate bones in the adult, not counting numerous small sesamoid bones .
The largest bone in the body is the femur or thigh-bone, and the smallest is the stapes in the middle ear .
The Greek word for bone is ὀστέον (osteon), hence the many terms that use it as a prefix – such as osteopathy .
A demon is a supernatural and often malevolent being prevalent historically in religion , occultism , literature , fiction , mythology , and folklore ; as well as in media such as comics , videogames , movies and television series .
The original Greek word daimon does not carry negative connotations.
The Ancient Greek word δαίμων daimōn denotes a spirit or divine power, much like the Latin genius or numen .
The Greek conception of a daimōn notably appears in the works of Plato , where it describes the divine inspiration of Socrates .
In Ancient Near Eastern religions and in the Abrahamic traditions , including ancient and medieval Christian demonology , a demon is considered a harmful spiritual entity which may cause demonic possession , calling for an exorcism .
In Western occultism and Renaissance magic , which grew out of an amalgamation of Greco-Roman magic , Jewish Aggadah and Christian demonology , a demon is believed to be a spiritual entity that may be conjured and controlled.
A train is a form of transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles that generally runs along a railroad track to transport cargo or passengers .
The word train comes from the Old French trahiner , derived from the Latin trahere meaning to pull or to draw.
Motive power for a train is provided by a separate locomotive or individual motors in a self-propelled multiple unit .
Although historically steam propulsion dominated, the most common types of locomotive are diesel and electric , the latter supplied by overhead wires or additional rails .
Trains can also be hauled by horses , pulled by engine or water-driven cable or wire winch , run downhill using gravity , or powered by pneumatics , gas turbines or batteries .
The track usually consists of two running rails with a fixed spacing , which may be supplemented by additional rails such as electric conducting rails and rack rails .
Monorails and maglev guideways are also used occasionally.
A passenger train includes passenger-carrying vehicles and can often be very long and fast.
One notable and growing long-distance train category is high-speed rail.
In order to achieve much faster operation at speeds of over 500 km/h (310 mph), innovative maglev technology has been the subject of research for many years.
The term light rail is sometimes used to refer to a modern tram system, but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train, similar to a heavy rail rapid transit system .
In most countries, the distinction between a tramway and a railway is precise and defined in law.
A freight train (or goods train) uses freight cars (or wagons/trucks) to transport goods or materials (cargo).
It is possible to carry passengers and freight in the same train using a mixed consist .
Rail cars and machinery that are used for the maintenance and repair of tracks, are termed maintenance of way equipment; these may be assembled into maintenance of way trains.
Similarly, dedicated trains may be used to provide support services to stations along a train line, such as garbage or revenue collection.
A goddess is a female deity .
Goddesses have been linked with virtues such as beauty , love , motherhood and fertility ( Mother-goddess cult in prehistoric times).
They have also been associated with ideas such as war , creation , and death .
In some faiths, a sacred female figure holds a central place in religious prayer and worship .
For example, Shaktism , the worship of the female force that animates the world, is one of the three major sects of Hinduism .
The primacy of a monotheistic or near-monotheistic Great Goddess is advocated by some modern matriarchists as a female version of, preceding, or analogue to, the Abrahamic God associated with the historical rise of monotheism in the Mediterranean Axis Age .
Polytheist religions , including Polytheistic reconstructionists , honour multiple goddesses and gods, and usually view them as discrete, separate beings.
These deities may be part of a pantheon, or different regions may have tutelary deities.
Rains may refer to:
A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops ; it is the basic facility in food production.
The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms , vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy , pig and poultry farms , and land used for the production of natural fibres , biofuel and other commodities .
It includes ranches , feedlots , orchards , plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land.
In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms , both of which can operate on land or sea.
Farming originated independently in different parts of the world, as hunter gatherer societies transitioned to food production rather than, food capture.
It may have started about 12,000 years ago with the domestication of livestock in the Fertile Crescent in western Asia, soon to be followed by the cultivation of crops.
Modern units tend to specialise in the crops or livestock best suited to the region, with their finished products being sold for the retail market or for further processing, with farm products being traded around the world.
Modern farms in developed countries are highly mechanized .
In the United States , livestock may be raised on rangeland and finished in feedlots and the mechanization of crop production has brought about a great decrease in the number of agricultural workers needed.
In Europe , traditional family farms are giving way to larger production units.
In Australia , some farms are very large because the land is unable to support a high stocking density of livestock because of climatic conditions.
In less developed countries, small farms are the norm, and the majority of rural residents are subsistence farmers , feeding their families and selling any surplus products in the local market.
A bullet is a kinetic projectile and the component of firearm ammunition that is expelled from the gun barrel during shooting .
The term is from Middle French and originated as the diminutive of the word boulle ( boullet ), which means small ball.
Bullets are made of a variety of materials such as copper , lead , steel , polymer , rubber and even wax .
They are available either singly as in muzzleloading and cap and ball firearms or as a component of paper cartridges , but much more commonly in the form of metallic cartridges .
Bullets are made in a large number of shapes and constructions depending on the intended applications, including specialized functions such as hunting , target shooting , training and combat .
Though the word bullet is often used incorrectly in colloquial language to refer to a cartridge round, a bullet is not a cartridge but rather a component of one.
A round of ammunition cartridge is a combination package of the bullet (which is the projectile), the case (which holds everything together), the propellant (which provide majority of the energy to launch the projectile) and the primer (which ignites the propellant).
This use of the term bullet when intending to describe a cartridge often leads to confusion when the components of a cartridge are specifically referred to.
Bullet sizes are expressed by their weights and diameters (referred to as calibers ) in both imperial and metric measurement systems.
For example: 55 grain .223 caliber bullets are of the same weight and caliber as 3.56 gram 5.56mm caliber bullets.
The bullets used in many cartridges are fired at muzzle velocities faster than the speed of sound — about 343 metres per second (1,130 ft/s) in dry air at 20 °C (68 °F) — and thus can travel a substantial distance to a target before a nearby observer hears the sound of the shot.
The sound of gunfire (i.e. the muzzle report) is often accompanied with a loud bullwhip -like crack as the supersonic bullet pierces through the air creating a sonic boom .
Bullet speeds at various stages of flight depend on intrinsic factors such as its sectional density , aerodynamic profile and ballistic coefficient , and extrinsic factors such as barometric pressure , humidity , air temperature and wind speed .
Subsonic cartridges fire bullets slower than the speed of sound so there is no sonic boom.
This means that a subsonic cartridge, such as .45 ACP , can be substantially quieter than a supersonic cartridge such as the .223 Remington , even without the use of a suppressor .
Bullets do not normally contain explosives , but damage the intended target by transferring kinetic energy upon impact and penetration (see terminal ballistics ).
Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity .
Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e., the state of being male, female, or an intersex variation), sex-based social structures (i.e., gender roles ), or gender identity .
Most cultures use a gender binary , having two genders ( boys / men and girls / women ); those who exist outside these groups fall under the umbrella term non-binary or genderqueer .
Some societies have specific genders besides man and woman, such as the hijras of South Asia ; these are often referred to as third genders (and fourth genders , etc).
Sexologist John Money introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role in 1955.
Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories .
However, Money's meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s, when feminist theory embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender .
Today, the distinction is followed in some contexts, especially the social sciences and documents written by the World Health Organization (WHO).
In other contexts, including some areas of the social sciences, gender includes sex or replaces it.
For instance, in non-human animal research, gender is commonly used to refer to the biological sex of the animals.
This change in the meaning of gender can be traced to the 1980s.
In 1993, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) started to use gender instead of sex .
Later, in 2011, the FDA reversed its position and began using sex as the biological classification and gender as a person's self representation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions based on the individual's gender presentation.
The social sciences have a branch devoted to gender studies .
Other sciences, such as sexology and neuroscience , are also interested in the subject.
The social sciences sometimes approach gender as a social construct , and gender studies particularly do, while research in the natural sciences investigates whether biological differences in males and females influence the development of gender in humans; both inform debate about how far biological differences influence the formation of gender identity.
In some English literature, there is also a trichotomy between biological sex, psychological gender, and social gender role.
This framework first appeared in a feminist paper on transsexualism in 1978.

A ritual (Sanskrit: ऋतु ritu - season) is a sequence of activities involving gestures , words, and objects, performed in a sequestered place, and performed according to set sequence.
Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community , including a religious community .
Rituals are characterized but not defined by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance.
Rituals are a feature of all known human societies.
They include not only the worship rites and sacraments of organized religions and cults, but also rites of passage , atonement and purification rites , oaths of allegiance , dedication ceremonies, coming of age ceremony or rites, coronations and presidential inaugurations , marriages and funerals, school rush traditions and graduations, club meetings, sporting events, Halloween parties, veterans parades, Christmas shopping and more.
Many activities that are ostensibly performed for concrete purposes, such as jury trials , execution of criminals, and scientific symposia , are loaded with purely symbolic actions prescribed by regulations or tradition, and thus partly ritualistic in nature.
Even common actions like hand-shaking and saying hello may be termed rituals .
The field of ritual studies has seen a number of conflicting definitions of the term.
One given by Kyriakidis is that a ritual is an outsider's or etic category for a set activity (or set of actions) that, to the outsider, seems irrational, non-contiguous, or illogical.
The term can be used also by the insider or emic performer as an acknowledgement that this activity can be seen as such by the uninitiated onlooker.
In psychology , the term ritual is sometimes used in a technical sense for a repetitive behavior systematically used by a person to neutralize or prevent anxiety; it can be a symptom of obsessive–compulsive disorder but obsessive-compulsive ritualistic behaviors are generally isolated activities.

V ( named vee ) is the 22nd letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet .
A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the display, cultivation, or enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature.
The garden can incorporate both natural and man-made materials.
The most common form today is a residential garden , but the term garden has traditionally been a more general one.
Zoos , which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called zoological gardens .
Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, with garden often signifying a shortened form of botanical garden .
Some traditional types of eastern gardens, such as Zen gardens , use plants sparsely or not at all.
Gardens may exhibit structural enhancements including statuary, follies , pergolas , trellises , stumperies , dry creek beds and water features such as fountains , ponds (with or without fish ), waterfalls or creeks.
Some gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while some gardens also produce food crops, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with the ornamental plants .
Food-producing gardens are distinguished from farms by their smaller scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby or self-sustenance rather than producing for sale).
Flower gardens combine plants of different heights, colors, textures, and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses.
Gardening is the activity of growing and maintaining the garden.
This work is done by an amateur or professional gardener .
A gardener might also work in a non-garden setting, such as a park, a roadside embankment, or other public space.
Landscape architecture is a related professional activity with landscape architects tending to specialise in design for public and corporate clients.
Quotation marks , also known as quotes , quote marks , quotemarks , speech marks , inverted commas , or talking marks , are punctuation marks used in pairs in various writing systems to set off direct speech , a quotation , or a phrase.
The pair consists of an opening quotation mark and a closing quotation mark, which may or may not be the same character.
Quotation marks have a variety of forms in different languages and in different media.

A skill is the ability to carry out a task with determined results often within a given amount of time, energy, or both.
Skills can often be divided into domain -general and domain-specific skills.
For example, in the domain of work, some general skills would include time management , teamwork and leadership, self-motivation and others, whereas domain-specific skills would be used only for a certain job.
Skill usually requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used.
People need a broad range of skills to contribute to a modern economy.
A joint ASTD and U.S. Department of Labor study showed that through technology, the workplace is changing, and identified 16 basic skills that employees must have to be able to change with it.
Three broad categories of skills are suggested and these are technical, human, and conceptual.
The first two can be substituted with hard and soft skills, respectively.

Powerball is an American lottery game offered by 44 states , the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands .
It is coordinated by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), a nonprofit organization formed by an agreement with US lotteries.
Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 graduated installments or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead.
One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the time value of money and also because one check for a much larger sum will be taxed at a greater rate than 30 checks each at a much lower sum will be taxed.
Drawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59 p.m. Eastern Time .
Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play.
Each play costs $2 or $3 with the Power Play option.
(Originally, Powerball plays cost $1; when PowerPlay began, such games were $2.) The official cutoff for ticket sales is 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time; some lotteries cut off sales earlier.
The drawings are usually held at the Florida Lottery 's studio in Tallahassee .
On January 13, 2016, Powerball produced the largest lottery jackpot in history; the $1.586 billion jackpot was split by three tickets sold in Chino Hills, California , in Munford, Tennessee , and in Melbourne Beach, Florida .

Canvas is an extremely durable plain-woven fabric used for making sails , tents , marquees , backpacks , and other items for which sturdiness is required, as well as in such fashion objects as handbags, electronic device cases, and shoes.
It is also popularly used by artists as a painting surface, typically stretched across a wooden frame.
Modern canvas is usually made of cotton or linen , along with polyvinyl chloride (PVC), although historically it was made from hemp .
It differs from other heavy cotton fabrics, such as denim , in being plain weave rather than twill weave .
Canvas comes in two basic types: plain and duck .
The threads in duck canvas are more tightly woven.
The term duck comes from the Dutch word for cloth, doek .
In the United States , canvas is classified in two ways: by weight (ounces per square yard) and by a graded number system.
The numbers run in reverse of the weight so a number 10 canvas is lighter than number 4.
In computer technology and telecommunications , online indicates a state of connectivity , and offline indicates a disconnected state.
In modern terminology this usually refers to an Internet connection , but (especially when expressed on line or on the line) could refer to any piece of equipment or functional unit that is connected to a larger system.
Being online means that the equipment or subsystem is connected, or that it is ready for use.
Online has come to describe activities performed on and data available on the Internet, for example: online identity , online predator , online gambling , online shopping , online banking , and online learning .
Similar meaning is also given by the prefixes cyber and e, as in the words cyberspace , cybercrime , email , and ecommerce .
In contrast, offline can refer to either computing activities performed while disconnected from the Internet, or alternatives to Internet activities (such as shopping in brick-and-mortar stores).
The term offline is sometimes used interchangeably with the acronym IRL, meaning in real life.
Cosmetics are substances or products used to enhance or alter the appearance of the face or fragrance and texture of the body.
Many cosmetics are designed for use of applying to the face and body.
They are generally mixtures of chemical compounds ; some being derived from natural sources (such as coconut oil ), and many synthetic or artificial.
Cosmetics that are applied to the face to enhance ones appearance are often called make-up or makeup .
Common make-up items include: lipstick , mascara , eye shadow , foundation , blush , and bronzer.
Other common cosmetics include skin cleansers , body lotions , shampoo and conditioner, hairstyling products ( gel , hair spray , etc.), perfume and cologne .
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates cosmetics, defines cosmetics as intended to be applied to the human body for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance without affecting the body's structure or functions.
This broad definition includes any material intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product.
The FDA specifically excludes pure soap from this category.

Revenge is defined as the act of commiting a harmful action against a person or group in response to a grievance , be it real or perceived (as opposed to turning the other cheek ).
It is used to punish a wrong by going outside the law.
Francis Bacon described revenge as a kind of wild justice that does...
offend the law and putteth the law out of office.
Primitive justice or retributive justice is often differentiated from more formal and refined forms of justice such as distributive justice and divine judgment .

Phonaesthetics (also spelled phonesthetics in North America) is the study of beauty and pleasantness associated with the sounds of certain words or parts of words.
The term was first used , perhaps by J.
Tolkien in this sense, during the mid-twentieth century, deriving from the Greek : φωνή phōnē , voice-sound plus Greek : αἰσθητική aisthētikē , aesthetic .
Speech sounds have many aesthetic qualities, some of which are subjectively regarded as euphonious (pleasing) or cacophonous (displeasing).
More broadly, phonaesthetics refers to the study of phonaesthesia: sound symbolism .
For instance, the British linguist David Crystal , who has compiled research on popular perceptions of beautiful-sounding English words, regards phonaesthetics as the study of aesthetic properties of sounds, especially the sound symbolism attributable to individual sounds.
An example is that English speakers tend to make an association of unpleasantness with the sound sl- in such words as sleazy , slime , slug , and slush , or an association of formless repetition with -tter in such words as chatter , glitter , flutter , and shatter .
Phonaesthetics remains a budding and often subjective field of study, with no formally established definition; today, it mostly exists as a marginal branch of psychology , phonetics , or poetics .

The right of a people to self-determination is a cardinal principle in modern international law (commonly regarded as a jus cogens rule), binding, as such, on the United Nations as authoritative interpretation of the Charter's norms.
It states that people, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity , have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference.
The concept was first expressed in the 1860s, and spread rapidly thereafter.
During and after World War I , the principle was encouraged by both Vladimir Lenin and United States President Woodrow Wilson .
Having announced his Fourteen Points on 8 January 1918, on 11 February 1918 Wilson stated: National aspirations must be respected; people may now be dominated and governed only by their own consent.
'Self determination' is not a mere phrase; it is an imperative principle of action.
During World War II , the principle was included in the Atlantic Charter , signed on 14 August 1941, by Franklin D.
Roosevelt , President of the United States, and Winston Churchill , Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who pledged The Eight Principal points of the Charter.
It was recognized as an international legal right after it was explicitly listed as a right in the UN Charter.
The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, nor what the outcome should be, whether it be independence , federation , protection , some form of autonomy or full assimilation .
Neither does it state what the delimitation between peoples should be—nor what constitutes a people .
There are conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination.
By extension, the term self-determination has come to mean the free choice of one's own acts without external compulsion.

Creature or creatures may also refer to:
A payment is the trade of value from one party (such as a person or company) to another for goods , or services , or to fulfill a legal obligation .
Payment can take a large variety of forms.
Barter , the exchange of one good or service for another, is a form of payment.
The most common means of payment involve use of money , cheque , or debit , credit or bank transfers .
Payments may also take complicated forms, such as stock issues or the transfer of anything of value or benefit to the parties.
In US law, the payer is the party making a payment while the payee is the party receiving the payment.
In trade , payments are frequently preceded by an invoice or bill.
In general, the payee is at liberty to determine what method of payment he or she will accept; though normally laws require the payer to accept the country's legal tender up to a prescribed limit.
Payment is most commonly effected in the local currency of the payee, unless if the parties agree otherwise.
Payment in another currency involves an additional foreign exchange transaction.
The payee may compromise on a debt, i.e., accept a part payment in full settlement of a debtor's obligation, or may offer a discount, E.G: For payment in cash, or for prompt payment, etc.
On the other hand, the payee may impose a surcharge , for example, as a late payment fee, or for use of a certain credit card, etc.
The acceptance of a payment by the payee extinguishes a debt or other obligation.
A creditor cannot unreasonably refuse to accept a payment, but payment can be refused in some circumstances, for example, on a Sunday or outside banking hours.
A payee is usually obligated to acknowledge payment by producing a receipt to the payer.
A receipt may be an endorsement on an account as paid in full.
The giving of a guarantee or other security for a debt does not constitute a payment.
A continent is one of several very large landmasses .
As of 2015 this type of landmass is known to exist only on Earth .
Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents.
Ordered from largest in area to smallest, they are: Asia , Africa , North America , South America , Antarctica , Europe , and Australia .
Geologically , the continents largely correspond to areas of continental crust that are found on the continental plates .
However, some areas of continental crust are regions covered with water not usually included in the list of continents.
Zealandia is one such area (see submerged continents below).
Islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world's land into geopolitical regions.
Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form a geopolitical region called Oceania .

A father is the male parent of a child .
Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may have a parental, legal, and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations.
An adoptive father is a male who has become the child's parent through the legal process of adoption .
A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the infant , through sexual intercourse or sperm donation .
A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support.
A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established.
A stepfather is a male who is the husband of a child's mother and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child.
The adjective paternal refers to a father and comparatively to maternal for a mother .
The verb to father means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun fathering.
Biological fathers determine the sex of their child through a sperm cell which either contains an X chromosome (female), or Y chromosome (male).
Related terms of endearment are dad ( dada , daddy ), papa , pappa , papasita, ( pa , pap ) and pop .
A male role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a father-figure .
A politician is a person active in party politics , or a person holding or seeking office in government.
Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people.
Broadly speaking, a politician can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.
A nightmare , also called a bad dream , is an unpleasant dream that can cause a strong emotional response from the mind, typically fear but also despair , anxiety and great sadness .
However, psychological nomenclature differentiates between nightmares and bad dreams, specifically, people remain asleep during bad dreams whereas nightmares awaken individuals.
Further, the process of psychological homeostasis employs bad dreams to protect an individual's Homeostatically Protected Mood (HPMood) from the impact of elevated anxiety levels.
During sleep, nightmares indicate the failure of the homeostatic system employing bad dreams to extinguish anxiety accumulated throughout the day.
The dream may contain situations of discomfort, psychological or physical terror or panic.
After a nightmare, a person will often awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a short period of time.
Nightmares can have physical causes such as sleeping in an uncomfortable position or having a fever , or psychological causes such as stress or anxiety .
Eating before going to sleep, which triggers an increase in the body's metabolism and brain activity, is a potential stimulus for nightmares.
Recurrent nightmares may require medical help, as they can interfere with sleeping patterns and cause insomnia .
A telephone (derived from the Greek : τῆλε , tēle , far and φωνή, phōnē , voice, together meaning distant voice), or phone , is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly.
A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice , into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user.
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice.
This instrument was further developed by many others.
The telephone was the first device in history that enabled people to talk directly with each other across large distances.
Telephones rapidly became indispensable to businesses, government and households.
The essential elements of a telephone are a microphone ( transmitter ) to speak into and an earphone ( receiver ) which reproduces the voice in a distant location.
In addition, most telephones contain a ringer to announce an incoming telephone call, and a dial or keypad to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone.
The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation.
The dial may be located either on the handset or on a base unit to which the handset is connected.
The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through a telephone network to the receiving telephone, which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a loudspeaker .
Telephones are duplex devices, meaning they permit transmission in both directions simultaneously.
The first telephones were directly connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location.
Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards .
These exchanges were soon connected together, eventually forming an automated, worldwide public switched telephone network .
For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the mid-20th century.
Hand-held mobile phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973.
In later decades their analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with greater capability and lower cost.
Convergence has given most modern cell phones capabilities far beyond simple voice conversation.
They may be able to record spoken messages , send and receive text messages , take and display photographs or video , play music or games , surf the Internet , do road navigation or immerse the user in virtual reality .
Since 1999, the trend for mobile phones is smartphones that integrate all mobile communication and computing needs.
A weapon , arm or armament is any implement or device that can be used with intent to inflict damage or harm.
Weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency of activities such as hunting , crime , law enforcement , self-defense , and warfare .
In broader context, weapons may be construed to include anything used to gain a tactical, strategic, material or mental advantage over an adversary or enemy target.
While ordinary objects – sticks, rocks, bottles, chairs, vehicles – can be used as weapons, many are expressly designed for the purpose; these range from simple implements such as clubs , axes and swords , to complicated modern firearms , tanks , intercontinental ballistic missiles , biological weapons, and cyberweapons .
Something that has been re-purposed, converted, or enhanced to become a weapon of war is termed weaponized , such as a weaponized virus or weaponized laser .

A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment.
A modern middle-class residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove , a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator , and worktops and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design .
Many households have a microwave oven , a dishwasher , and other electric appliances.
The main functions of a kitchen are to store, prepare and cook food (and to complete related tasks such as dishwashing ).
The room or area may also be used for dining (or small meals such as breakfast), entertaining and laundry .
The design and construction of kitchens is a huge market all over the world.
Commercial kitchens are found in restaurants , cafeterias , hotels , hospitals , educational and workplace facilities, army barracks, and similar establishments.
These kitchens are generally larger and equipped with bigger and more heavy-duty equipment than a residential kitchen.
For example, a large restaurant may have a huge walk-in refrigerator and a large commercial dishwasher machine.
In some instances commercial kitchen equipment such as commercial sinks are used in household settings as it offers ease of use for food preparation and high durability.
In developed countries, commercial kitchens are generally subject to public health laws.
They are inspected periodically by public-health officials, and forced to close if they do not meet hygienic requirements mandated by law.
Cooking or cookery is the art , technology , science and craft of preparing food for consumption.
Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world , from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves , to baking in various types of ovens , reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends.
The ways or types of cooking also depend on the skill and type of training an individual cook has.
Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments.
Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat, such as in ceviche , a traditional South American dish where fish is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice.
Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans.
It may have started around 2 million years ago, though archaeological evidence for it reaches no more than 1 million years ago.
The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade, and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients.
New inventions and technologies, such as the invention of pottery for holding and boiling water, expanded cooking techniques.
Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served.

Sushi ( すし, 寿司, 鮨 , pronounced sɯꜜɕi or sɯɕiꜜ ) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice ( 鮨飯 , sushi-meshi ) , usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients ( ネタ , neta ) , such as seafood , vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits .
Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is sushi rice, also referred to as shari ( しゃり ) , or sumeshi ( 酢飯 ) .
Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice , though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice .
It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid , eel , yellowtail , salmon , tuna or imitation crab meat .
Many types of sushi are vegetarian .
It is often served with pickled ginger ( gari ), wasabi , and soy sauce .
Daikon radish or pickled daikon ( takuan ) are popular garnishes for the dish.
Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi , a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish , or occasionally meat , and an optional serving of rice.

A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle, such as a body of water , valley , or road , without closing the way underneath.
It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, usually something that can be detrimental to cross otherwise.
There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations.
Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it.
Most likely the earliest bridges were fallen trees and stepping stones , while Neolithic people built boardwalk bridges across marshland.
The Arkadiko Bridge dating from the 13th century BC, in the Peloponnese , in southern Greece is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use.

Transport or transportation is the movement of humans, animals and goods from one location to another.
In other words, the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A to a Point B.
Modes of transport include air , land ( rail and road ), water , cable , pipeline and space .
The field can be divided into infrastructure , vehicles and operations .
Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of civilizations .
Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including roads , railways , airways , waterways , canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports , railway stations , bus stations , warehouses , trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel stations ) and seaports .
Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.
Vehicles traveling on these networks may include automobiles , bicycles , buses , trains , trucks , helicopters , watercraft , spacecraft and aircraft .
Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies.
In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.
Passenger transport may be public , where operators provide scheduled services, or private .
Freight transport has become focused on containerization , although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items.
Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization , but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land .
While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow and restrain urban sprawl .
Fear is a feeling induced by perceived danger or threat that occurs in certain types of organisms , which causes a change in metabolic and organ functions and ultimately a change in behavior , such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events.
Fear in human beings may occur in response to a certain stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to body or life.
The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response ), which in extreme cases of fear ( horror and terror ) can be a freeze response or paralysis .
In humans and animals, fear is modulated by the process of cognition and learning.
Thus fear is judged as rational or appropriate and irrational or inappropriate.
An irrational fear is called a phobia .
Psychologists such as John B.
Watson , Robert Plutchik , and Paul Ekman have suggested that there is only a small set of basic or innate emotions and that fear is one of them.
This hypothesized set includes such emotions as acute stress reaction , anger , angst , anxiety , fright, horror , joy , panic , and sadness .
Fear is closely related to, but should be distinguished from, the emotion anxiety , which occurs as the result of threats that are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable.
The fear response serves survival by engendering appropriate behavioral responses, so it has been preserved throughout evolution .
Sociological and organizational research also suggests that individuals fears are not solely dependent on their nature but are also shaped by their social relations and culture, which guide their understanding of when and how much fear to feel.
A textile is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibers ( yarn or thread ).
Yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool , flax , cotton , hemp , or other materials to produce long strands.
Textiles are formed by weaving , knitting , crocheting , knotting or tatting , felting , or braiding .
The related words fabric and cloth and material are often used in textile assembly trades (such as tailoring and dressmaking ) as synonyms for textile .
However, there are subtle differences in these terms in specialized usage.
A textile is any material made of interlacing fibres, including carpeting and geotextiles .
A fabric is a material made through weaving, knitting, spreading, crocheting, or bonding that may be used in production of further goods (garments, etc.).
Cloth may be used synonymously with fabric but is often a piece of fabric that has been processed.
In human anatomy , the thigh is the area between the hip ( pelvis ) and the knee .
Anatomically, it is part of the lower limb .
The single bone in the thigh is called the femur .
This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of bone tissue ), and forms a ball and socket joint at the hip , and a modified hinge joint at the knee.
Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ , observed on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.
A feast central to the Christian liturgical year , it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide , which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night ; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an octave .
Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations , is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday season centered around it.
The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem , in accordance with messianic prophecies .
When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then further disseminated the information.
Although the month and date of Jesus' birth are unknown, the church in the early fourth century fixed the date as December 25.
This corresponds to the date of the solstice on the Roman calendar.
Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar , which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world.
However, some Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar , which currently corresponds to a January date in the Gregorian calendar.
For Christians, the belief that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than the exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.
The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian , Christian, and secular themes and origins.
Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving , completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath , Christmas music and caroling , lighting a Christingle , viewing a Nativity play , an exchange of Christmas cards , church services , a special meal , pulling Christmas crackers and the display of various Christmas decorations , including Christmas trees , Christmas lights , nativity scenes , garlands , wreaths , mistletoe , and holly .
In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus , Father Christmas , Saint Nicholas , and Christkind , are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore.
Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses.
The economic impact of Christmas has grown steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.
A dress (also known as a frock or a gown ) is a garment traditionally worn by women or girls consisting of a skirt with an attached bodice (or a matching bodice giving the effect of a one-piece garment).
It consists of a top piece that covers the torso and hangs down over the legs.
A dress can be any one-piece garment containing a skirt of any length and can be formal or casual.
The hemlines of dresses vary depending on modesty , weather, fashion or the personal taste of the wearer.
A husband is a male in a marital relationship , who may also be referred to as a spouse or partner.
The rights and obligations of a husband regarding his spouse and others, and his status in the community and in law, vary between societies, cultures and have varied over time.
In monogamous cultures, there are only two parties to a marriage, which is enforced by laws against bigamy and polygamy .
Traditionally, the husband was regarded as the head of the household and was expected to be the sole provider or breadwinner , a role that continues in some cultures (sometimes described as paternalistic ).
Today, a husband is not necessarily considered the breadwinner of the family, especially if his spouse has a more financially rewarding occupation or career.
In such cases, it is not uncommon for a husband to be considered a stay-at-home father if the married couple have children.
The term continues to be applied to such a man who has separated from his spouse and ceases to be applied to him only when his marriage has come to an end following a legally recognized divorce or the death of his spouse.
On the death of his spouse, a husband is referred to as a widower ; after a divorce a man may be referred to as the ex-husband of his former spouse.

Durante di Alighiero degli Alighieri ( Italian: duˈrante deʎʎ aliˈɡjɛːri ; Latin : Dantes ), commonly known by his pen name Dante Alighieri or simply as Dante ( , also US : , Italian: ˈdante ; c.
1265 – 1321), was an Italian poet .
His Divine Comedy , originally called Comedìa (modern Italian: Commedia ) and later christened Divina by Giovanni Boccaccio , is widely considered the most important poem of the Middle Ages and the greatest literary work in the Italian language .
In the Late Middle Ages , most poetry was written in Latin , making it accessible only to the most educated readers.
In De vulgari eloquentia ( On Eloquence in the Vernacular ), however, Dante defended the use of the vernacular in literature.
He would even write in the Tuscan dialect for works such as The New Life (1295) and the Divine Comedy ; this highly unorthodox choice set a precedent that important later Italian writers such as Petrarch and Boccaccio would follow.
Dante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy , and his depictions of Hell , Purgatory and Heaven provided inspiration for the larger body of Western art .
He is cited as an influence on John Milton , Geoffrey Chaucer and Alfred Tennyson , among many others.
In addition, the first use of the interlocking three-line rhyme scheme, or the terza rima , is attributed to him.
He is described as the father of the Italian language, and in Italy, he is often referred to as il Sommo Poeta (the Supreme Poet).
Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio are also called the tre corone (three crowns) of Italian literature.
A turbine (from the Latin turbo , a vortex , related to the Greek τύρβη , tyrbē , meaning turbulence ) is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work .
The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator .
A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached.
Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor.
Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels .
Gas , steam , and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid.
Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to Anglo-Irish engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931) for invention of the reaction turbine, and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913) for invention of the impulse turbine.
Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.
The word turbine was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo , or vortex , in a memo, Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse, which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.
Benoit Fourneyron , a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.

Hindus ( Hindustani: ˈɦɪndu ( listen ) ) are persons who regard themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism .
Historically, the term has also been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people living in the Hind ( Indian subcontinent ).
The historical meaning of the term Hindu has evolved with time.
Starting with the Persian and Greek references to the land of the Indus in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era, the term Hindu implied a geographic, ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent around or beyond the Sindhu ( Indus ) river.
By the 16th century, the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims.
The historical development of Hindu self-identity within the local South Asian population, in a religious or cultural sense, is unclear.
Competing theories state that Hindu identity developed in the British colonial era, or that it may have developed post-8th century CE after the Islamic invasion and medieval Hindu-Muslim wars.
A sense of Hindu identity and the term Hindu appears in some texts dated between the 13th and 18th century in Sanskrit and regional languages.
The 14th- and 18th-century Indian poets such as Vidyapati , Kabir and Eknath used the phrase Hindu dharma (Hinduism) and contrasted it with Turaka dharma (Islam).
The Christian friar Sebastiao Manrique used the term 'Hindu' in religious context in 1649.
In the 18th century, the European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of Indian religions collectively as Hindus , in contrast to Mohamedans for Mughals and Arabs following Islam.
By the mid-19th century, colonial orientalist texts further distinguished Hindus from Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains, but the colonial laws continued to consider all of them to be within the scope of the term Hindu until about mid-20th century.
Scholars state that the custom of distinguishing between Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs is a modern phenomenon.
Hindoo is an archaic spelling variant, whose use today may be considered derogatory.
At more than 1.03 billion, Hindus are the world's third largest group after Christians and Muslims .
The vast majority of Hindus , approximately 966 million, live in India, according to India's 2011 census.
After India, the next 9 countries with the largest Hindu populations are, in decreasing order: Nepal , Bangladesh , Indonesia , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , United States , Malaysia , United Kingdom and Myanmar .
These together accounted for 99% of the world's Hindu population, and the remaining nations of the world together had about 6 million Hindus in 2010.
Kindness is a behavior marked by ethical characteristics, a pleasant disposition , and concern and consideration for others.
It is considered a virtue , and is recognized as a value in many cultures and religions (see ethics in religion ).
In Book II of Rhetoric , Aristotle defines kindness as helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return for anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself, but for that of the person helped.
Nietzsche considered kindness and love to be the most curative herbs and agents in human intercourse.
Kindness is considered to be one of the Knightly Virtues .
In Meher Baba 's teachings, God is synonymous with kindness: God is so kind that it is impossible to imagine His unbounded kindness!
A honeymoon is a holiday taken by newlyweds immediately after their wedding , to celebrate their marriage .
Today, honeymoons are often celebrated in destinations considered exotic or romantic.

Recruitment refers to the overall process of attracting, shortlisting, selecting and appointing suitable candidates for jobs (either permanent or temporary) within an organization.
Recruitment can also refer to processes involved in choosing individuals for unpaid roles.
Managers, human resource generalists and recruitment specialists may be tasked with carrying out recruitment, but in some cases public-sector employment agencies, commercial recruitment agencies, or specialist search consultancies are used to undertake parts of the process.
Internet-based technologies which support all aspects of recruitment have become widespread.
Leo is the Latin word for lion.
Leo or LEO may refer to:
Authority is the right to exercise power , which can be formalized by a state and exercised by way of judges, appointed executives of government, or the ecclesiastical or priestly appointed representatives of a God or other deities .
Authority, in the sense of authorization, can also mean the right to complete an action or execute an order.
In government , authority is often used interchangeably with power .
However, their meanings differ: while power is the ability to order or accomplish a goal or to influence others, authority refers to a claim of legitimacy , the justification and right to exercise that power.
For example, while a mob may have the power to punish a criminal by beating or lynching , the rule of law indicates that only a court of law has the authority to determine and refer a criminal for punishment.
In this sense, authority is a matter of not only the ability or power to make decisions , but the right to make these decisions and execute them with commensurate power.
Appropriate authority is the basis of good government in the republican conception of government, which finds much of its theoretical origins in ancient Rome .
Burial or interment is a method of final disposition wherein a dead person or animal is placed into the ground, sometimes with objects.
This is usually accomplished by excavating a pit or trench, placing the deceased and objects in it, and covering it over.
A funeral is a ceremony that accompanies the final disposition.
Humans have been burying their dead since shortly after the origin of the species.
Burial is often seen as indicating respect for the dead.
It has been used to prevent the odor of decay, to give family members closure and prevent them from witnessing the decomposition of their loved ones, and in many cultures it has been seen as a necessary step for the deceased to enter the afterlife or to give back to the cycle of life.
Methods of burial may be heavily ritualized and can include natural burial (sometimes called green burial); embalming or mummification ; and the use of containers for the dead, such as shrouds , coffins , grave liners , and burial vaults , all of which can retard decomposition of the body.
Sometimes objects or grave goods are buried with the body, which may be dressed in fancy or ceremonial garb.
Depending on the culture, the way the body is positioned may have great significance.
The location of the burial may be determined by taking into account concerns surrounding health and sanitation, religious concerns, and cultural practices.
Some cultures keep the dead close to provide guidance to the living, while others banish them by locating burial grounds at a distance from inhabited areas.
Some religions consecrate special ground to bury the dead, and some families build private family cemeteries .
Most modern cultures document the location of graves with headstones , which may be inscribed with information and tributes to the deceased.
However, some people are buried in anonymous or secret graves for various reasons.
Sometimes multiple bodies are buried in a single grave either by choice (as in the case of married couples), due to space concerns, or in the case of mass graves as a way to deal with many bodies at once.
Alternatives to burial may include cremation (and subsequent interment ), burial at sea , promession , cryopreservation , and others.
Some human cultures may bury the remains of beloved animals .
Humans are not the only species which bury their dead; the practice has been observed in chimpanzees , elephants , and possibly dogs .

Benghazi ( ) is a city in Libya .
Located on the Gulf of Sidra in the Mediterranean , Benghazi is a major seaport and the second-most populous city in the country, as well as the largest city in Cyrenaica , with an estimated population of 631,555 in 2011.
A Greek colony named Euesperides had existed in the area from around 525 BC.
In the 3rd century BC, it was relocated and refounded as the Ptolemaic city of Berenice.
Berenice prospered under the Romans, and after the 3rd century AD it superseded Cyrene and Barca as the center of Cyrenaica.
The city went into decline during the Byzantine period and had already been reduced to a small town before its conquest by the Arabs .
In 1911, Italy captured Benghazi and the rest of Tripolitania from the Ottomans .
Under Italian rule, Benghazi witnessed a period of extensive development and modernization, particularly in the second half of the 1930s.
The city changed hands several times during World War II and was heavily damaged in the process.
After the war Benghazi was rebuilt and became the co-capital of the newly independent Kingdom of Libya .
Following the 1969 coup d'état by Muammar Gaddafi , Benghazi lost its capital status and all government offices relocated to Tripoli .
On 15 February 2011 , an uprising against the government of Muammar Gaddafi occurred in the city.
The revolts spread by 17 February to Bayda , Tobruk , Ajdabya , Al Marj in the East and Zintan , Zawiya in the West, calling for the end of the Gaddafi Regime.
Benghazi was taken by Gaddafi opponents on 21 February, who founded the National Transitional Council .
On 19 March, the city was the site of the turning point of the Libyan Civil War , when the Libyan Army attempted to score a decisive victory against the NTC by attacking Benghazi, but was forced back by local resistance and intervention from the French Air Force authorized by UNSC Resolution 1973 to protect civilians, allowing the rebellion to continue.
Benghazi remains a center of Libyan commerce, industry, transport and culture.
It continues to hold institutions and organizations normally associated with a capital city, including several national government buildings as well as the National Library of Libya .
In politics, humanitarian aid, and social science, hunger is a condition in which a person, for a sustained period, is unable to eat sufficient food to meet basic nutritional needs.
So in the field of hunger relief, the term hunger is used in a sense that goes beyond the common desire for food that all humans experience.
Throughout history, portions of the world's population have often suffered sustained periods of hunger.
In many cases, this resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather.
In the decades following World War II , technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger.
While progress was uneven, by 2015 the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the world's people.
According to figures published by the FAO in 2019 however, the number of people suffering from chronic hunger has been increasing over the last four years.
This is both as a percentage of the world's population, and in absolute terms, with about 821 million afflicted with hunger in 2018.
While most of the world's hungry people continue to live in Asia, much of the increase in hunger since 2015 occurred in Africa and South America.
The FAO's 2017 report discussed three principal reasons for the recent increase in hunger: climate, conflict, and economic slowdowns.
The 2018 report focused on extreme weather as a primary driver of the increase in hunger, finding rises were especially severe in countries where the agricultural systems were most sensitive to extreme variations in weather.
While the FAO's 2019 report found there was also a strong correlation between increases in hunger and countries that had suffered an economic slowdown .
Many thousands of organisations are engaged in the field of hunger relief; operating at local, national, regional or international levels.
Some of these organisations are dedicated to hunger relief, while others may work in a number of different fields.
The organisations range from multilateral institutions, to national governments, to small local initiatives such as independent soup kitchens.
Many participate in umbrella networks that connect together thousands of different hunger relief organisations.
At the global level, much of the world's hunger relief efforts are coordinated by the UN, and geared towards achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal for Zero hunger .
A photograph (also known as a photo ) is an image created by light falling on a photosensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic image sensor , such as a CCD or a CMOS chip.
Most photographs are created using a camera , which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see.
The process and practice of creating such images is called photography .
The word photograph was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek φῶς ( phos ), meaning light, and γραφή ( graphê ), meaning drawing, writing, together meaning drawing with light.
A bean is a seed of one of several genera of the flowering plant family Fabaceae , which are used for human or animal food.
Libya ( ( listen ) ; Arabic : ليبيا ‎, romanized : Lībiyā ), officially the State of Libya , is a country in the Maghreb region in North Africa , bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad to the south, Niger to the southwest, Algeria to the west, and Tunisia to the northwest.
The sovereign state is made of three historical regions: Tripolitania , Fezzan and Cyrenaica .
With an area of almost 1.8 million square kilometres (700,000 sq mi), Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa, and is the 16th largest country in the world .
Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world.
The largest city and capital, Tripoli , is located in western Libya and contains over one million of Libya's six million people.
The second-largest city is Benghazi , which is located in eastern Libya.
Libya has been inhabited by Berbers since the late Bronze Age .
The Phoenicians established trading posts in western Libya, and ancient Greek colonists established city-states in eastern Libya.
Libya was variously ruled by Carthaginians , Persians , Egyptians and Greeks before becoming a part of the Roman Empire .
Libya was an early centre of Christianity .
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , the area of Libya was mostly occupied by the Vandals until the 7th century, when invasions brought Islam to the region.
In the 16th century, the Spanish Empire and the Knights of St John occupied Tripoli , until Ottoman rule began in 1551 .
Libya was involved in the Barbary Wars of the 18th and 19th centuries.
Ottoman rule continued until the Italian occupation of Libya resulted in the temporary Italian Libya colony from 1911 to 1947.
During the Second World War , Libya was an important area of warfare in the North African Campaign .
The Italian population then went into decline.
Libya became independent as a kingdom in 1951.
A military coup in 1969 overthrew King Idris I .
The bloodless coup leader Muammar Gaddafi ruled the country from 1969 and the Libyan Cultural Revolution in 1973 until he was overthrown and killed in the 2011 Libyan Civil War .
Two authorities initially claimed to govern Libya: the Council of Deputies in Tobruk and the 2014 General National Congress (GNC) in Tripoli, which considered itself the continuation of the General National Congress , elected in 2012 .
After UN -led peace talks between the Tobruk and Tripoli governments, a unified interim UN-backed Government of National Accord was established in 2015, and the GNC disbanded to support it.
Parts of Libya remain outside either government's control, with various Islamist , rebel and tribal militias administering some areas.
As of July 2017, talks are still ongoing between the GNA and the Tobruk-based authorities to end the strife and unify the divided establishments of the state, including the Libyan National Army and the Central Bank of Libya .
Libya is a member of the United Nations (since 1955), the Non-Aligned Movement , the Arab League , the OIC and OPEC .
The country's official religion is Islam , with 96.6% of the Libyan population being Sunni Muslims .
A bucket is typically a watertight, vertical cylinder or truncated cone or square, with an open top and a flat bottom, attached to a semicircular carrying handle called the bail .
A bucket is usually an open-top container.
In contrast, a pail can have a top or lid and is a shipping container .
In common usage, the two terms are often used interchangeably.
Female (♀) is the sex of an organism , or a part of an organism, that produces non-mobile ova (egg cells).
Barring rare medical conditions, most female mammals , including female humans , have two X chromosomes .
Female characteristics vary between different species with some species containing more well defined female characteristics.
Both genetics and environment shape the prenatal development of a female.
A party is a gathering of people who have been invited by a host for the purposes of socializing , conversation , recreation , or as part of a festival or other commemoration of a special occasion.
A party will typically feature food and beverages , and often music and dancing or other forms of entertainment .
In many Western countries, parties for teens and adults are associated with drinking alcohol such as beer , wine , or distilled spirits .
Poaceae ( pɔaˈkɛ.ɛ ) or Gramineae is a large and nearly ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants known as grasses , commonly referred to collectively as grass .
Poaceae includes the cereal grasses, bamboos and the grasses of natural grassland and cultivated lawns and pasture.
Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks.
The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem, forming a leaf-sheath.
With around 780 genera and around 12,000 species, Poaceae are the fifth-largest plant family , following the Asteraceae , Orchidaceae , Fabaceae and Rubiaceae .
Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant are estimated to constitute 40.5% of the land area of the Earth , excluding Greenland and Antarctica .
Grasses are also an important part of the vegetation in many other habitats, including wetlands , forests and tundra .The Poaceae are the most economically important plant family, providing staple foods from domesticated cereal crops such as maize , wheat , rice , barley , and millet as well as forage, building materials ( bamboo , thatch , straw ) and fuel ( ethanol ).
Though they are commonly called grasses, seagrasses , rushes , and sedges fall outside this family.
The rushes and sedges are related to the Poaceae, being members of the order Poales , but the seagrasses are members of order Alismatales .
Experience is the knowledge or mastery of an event or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it.
Terms in philosophy such as empirical knowledge or a posteriori knowledge are used to refer to knowledge based on experience.
A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an expert .
The concept of experience generally refers to know-how or procedural knowledge , rather than propositional knowledge : on-the-job training rather than book-learning.
The interrogation of experience has a long term tradition in continental philosophy.
Experience plays an important role in the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard .
The German term Erfahrung , often translated into English as experience, has a slightly different implication, connoting the coherency of life 's experiences.
Certain religious traditions (such as Buddhism , Surat Shabd Yoga , mysticism and Pentecostalism ) and educational paradigms with, for example, the conditioning of military recruit-training (also known as boot camps), stress the experiential nature of human epistemology .
This stands in contrast to alternatives: traditions of dogma , logic or reasoning .
Participants in activities such as tourism , extreme sports and recreational drug-use also tend to stress the importance of experience.
The history of the word experience aligns it closely with the concept of experiment .
Tom or TOM may refer to:

Carcasses is also a family name originating from the town of Carcassonne , Aude, France.
People with this name include:
Sample or samples may refer to:
Commerce relates to the exchange of goods and services , especially on a large scale.
It includes legal, economic, political, social, cultural and technological systems that operate in a country or in international trade .
Sunlight is a portion of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the Sun , in particular infrared , visible , and ultraviolet light.
On Earth , sunlight is filtered through Earth's atmosphere , and is obvious as daylight when the Sun is above the horizon .
When the direct solar radiation is not blocked by clouds , it is experienced as sunshine , a combination of bright light and radiant heat .
When it is blocked by clouds or reflects off other objects , it is experienced as diffused light.
The World Meteorological Organization uses the term sunshine duration to mean the cumulative time during which an area receives direct irradiance from the Sun of at least 120 watts per square meter .
Other sources indicate an Average over the entire earth of 164 Watts per square meter over a 24 hour day.
The ultraviolet radiation in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects, as it is both a requisite for vitamin D 3 synthesis and a mutagen .
Sunlight takes about 8.3 minutes to reach Earth from the surface of the Sun.
A photon starting at the center of the Sun and changing direction every time it encounters a charged particle would take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to get to the surface.
Sunlight is a key factor in photosynthesis , the process used by plants and other autotrophic organisms to convert light energy , normally from the Sun, into chemical energy that can be used to synthesize carbohydrates and to fuel the organisms' activities.
In chemistry , a solution is a special type of homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances.
In such a mixture, a solute is a substance dissolved in another substance, known as a solvent .
The mixing process of a solution happens at a scale where the effects of chemical polarity are involved, resulting in interactions that are specific to solvation .
The solution assumes the phase of the solvent when the solvent is the larger fraction of the mixture, as is commonly the case.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is the mass of that solute expressed as a percentage of the mass of the whole solution.
The term aqueous solution is when one of the solvents is water.
A continent is one of several very large landmasses .
As of 2015 this type of landmass is known to exist only on Earth .
Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents.
Ordered from largest in area to smallest, they are: Asia , Africa , North America , South America , Antarctica , Europe , and Australia .
Geologically , the continents largely correspond to areas of continental crust that are found on the continental plates .
However, some areas of continental crust are regions covered with water not usually included in the list of continents.
Zealandia is one such area (see submerged continents below).
Islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world's land into geopolitical regions.
Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form a geopolitical region called Oceania .
A seed is an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering.
The formation of the seed is part of the process of reproduction in seed plants, the spermatophytes , including the gymnosperm and angiosperm plants.
Seeds are the product of the ripened ovule , after fertilization by pollen and some growth within the mother plant.
The embryo is developed from the zygote and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule.
Seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and success of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants, relative to more primitive plants such as ferns , mosses and liverworts , which do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves.
Seed plants now dominate biological niches on land, from forests to grasslands both in hot and cold climates .
The term seed also has a general meaning that antedates the above – anything that can be sown , e.g. seed potatoes , seeds of corn or sunflower seeds .
In the case of sunflower and corn seeds, what is sown is the seed enclosed in a shell or husk , whereas the potato is a tuber .
Many structures commonly referred to as seeds are actually dry fruits .
Plants producing berries are called baccate.
Sunflower seeds are sometimes sold commercially while still enclosed within the hard wall of the fruit, which must be split open to reach the seed.
Different groups of plants have other modifications, the so-called stone fruits (such as the peach ) have a hardened fruit layer (the endocarp) fused to and surrounding the actual seed.
Nuts are the one-seeded, hard-shelled fruit of some plants with an indehiscent seed, such as an acorn or hazelnut .
López is a surname of Spanish origin.
It was originally a patronymic , meaning Son of Lope, Lope itself being a Spanish given name deriving from Latin lupus , meaning wolf .
The surname is first attested in Old Castile in the heart of Spain , where the name originated in Visigothic times ; however, the name is not of Germanic origin.
Its Portuguese equivalent is Lopes , its Italian equivalent is Lupo , its French equivalent is Loup (or Leu ), its Romanian equivalent is Lupu or Lupescu and its Valencian equivalent is Llopis .
López is the fifth most common hispanic surname globally and in Spain and the USA.
It is the most common surname in the province of Lugo.
In the UK, it is the most common Spanish surname in the United Kingdom .
Chalk is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock , a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite .
Calcite is an ionic salt called calcium carbonate or CaCO 3 .
It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells ( coccoliths ) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores .
Flint (a type of chert ) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk.
It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction.
Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint).
Chalk as seen in Cretaceous deposits of Western Europe is unusual among sedimentary limestones in the thickness of the beds.
Most cliffs of chalk have very few obvious bedding planes unlike most thick sequences of limestone such as the Carboniferous Limestone or the Jurassic oolitic limestones.
This presumably indicates very stable conditions over tens of millions of years.
Chalk has greater resistance to weathering and slumping than the clays with which it is usually associated, thus forming tall, steep cliffs where chalk ridges meet the sea.
Chalk hills , known as chalk downland , usually form where bands of chalk reach the surface at an angle, so forming a scarp slope.
Because chalk is well jointed it can hold a large volume of ground water , providing a natural reservoir that releases water slowly through dry seasons.
Iwate can refer to:
According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a runway is a defined rectangular area on a land aerodrome prepared for the landing and takeoff of aircraft .
Runways may be a man-made surface (often asphalt , concrete , or a mixture of both) or a natural surface ( grass , dirt , gravel , ice , sand or salt ).
Runways, as well as taxiways and ramps, are sometimes referred to as “tarmac,” though very few runways are built using tarmac.
Towns may refer to:
Vogue may refer to:
Femininity (also called girlishness or womanliness ) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles generally associated with girls and women.
Femininity is socially constructed, but made up of both socially-defined and biologically-created factors.
This makes it distinct from the definition of the biological female sex , as both males and females can exhibit feminine traits.
Traits traditionally cited as feminine include gentleness , empathy , humility , and sensitivity , though traits associated with femininity vary depending on location and context, and are influenced by a variety of social and cultural factors.
Tear , Tears or Tearing may refer to:
Spotlight or spot light may refer to:
Director may refer to:
Predation is a biological interaction where one organism, the predator , kills and eats another organism, its prey .
It is one of a family of common feeding behaviours that includes parasitism and micropredation (which usually do not kill the host ) and parasitoidism (which always does, eventually).
It is distinct from scavenging on dead prey, though many predators also scavenge; it overlaps with herbivory, as a seed predator is both a predator and a herbivore .
Predators may actively search for prey or sit and wait for it.
When prey is detected, the predator assesses whether to attack it.
This may involve ambush or pursuit predation , sometimes after stalking the prey.
If the attack is successful, the predator kills the prey, removes any inedible parts like the shell or spines, and eats it.
Predators are adapted and often highly specialized for hunting, with acute senses such as vision , hearing , or smell .
Many predatory animals , both vertebrate and invertebrate , have sharp claws or jaws to grip, kill, and cut up their prey.
Other adaptations include stealth and aggressive mimicry that improve hunting efficiency.
Predation has a powerful selective effect on prey, and the prey develop antipredator adaptations such as warning coloration , alarm calls and other signals , camouflage , mimicry of well-defended species, and defensive spines and chemicals.
Sometimes predator and prey find themselves in an evolutionary arms race , a cycle of adaptations and counter-adaptations.
Predation has been a major driver of evolution since at least the Cambrian period.
A floor is the bottom surface of a room or vehicle.
Floors vary from simple dirt in a cave to many-layered surfaces made with modern technology.
Floors may be stone, wood, bamboo, metal or any other material that can support the expected load.
The levels of a building are often referred to as floors, although a more proper term is storey .
Floors typically consist of a subfloor for support and a floor covering used to give a good walking surface.
In modern buildings the subfloor often has electrical wiring, plumbing, and other services built in.
As floors must meet many needs, some essential to safety, floors are built to strict building codes in some regions.

It may also refer to:
A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the display, cultivation, or enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature.
The garden can incorporate both natural and man-made materials.
The most common form today is a residential garden , but the term garden has traditionally been a more general one.
Zoos , which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called zoological gardens .
Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, with garden often signifying a shortened form of botanical garden .
Some traditional types of eastern gardens, such as Zen gardens , use plants sparsely or not at all.
Gardens may exhibit structural enhancements including statuary, follies , pergolas , trellises , stumperies , dry creek beds and water features such as fountains , ponds (with or without fish ), waterfalls or creeks.
Some gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while some gardens also produce food crops, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with the ornamental plants .
Food-producing gardens are distinguished from farms by their smaller scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby or self-sustenance rather than producing for sale).
Flower gardens combine plants of different heights, colors, textures, and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses.
Gardening is the activity of growing and maintaining the garden.
This work is done by an amateur or professional gardener .
A gardener might also work in a non-garden setting, such as a park, a roadside embankment, or other public space.
Landscape architecture is a related professional activity with landscape architects tending to specialise in design for public and corporate clients.
An autobiography (from the Greek , αὐτός- autos self + βίος- bios life + γράφειν- graphein to write) is a self-written account of the life of oneself.
The word autobiography was first used deprecatingly by William Taylor in 1797 in the English periodical The Monthly Review , when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as pedantic.
However, its next recorded use was in its present sense, by Robert Southey in 1809.
Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century, first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity.
Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that autobiography is a review of a life from a particular moment in time, while the diary, however reflective it may be, moves through a series of moments in time.
Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer's life from the moment of composition.
While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints, autobiography may be based entirely on the writer's memory.
The memoir form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends, as Pascal claims, to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer's review of his or her life.
Agency may refer to:
Canning is a method of preserving food in which the food contents are processed and sealed in an airtight container ( jars like Mason jars , and steel and tin cans ).
Canning provides a shelf life typically ranging from one to five years, although under specific circumstances it can be much longer.
A freeze-dried canned product, such as canned dried lentils , could last as long as 30 years in an edible state.
In 1974, samples of canned food from the wreck of the Bertrand , a steamboat that sank in the Missouri River in 1865, were tested by the National Food Processors Association .
Although appearance, smell and vitamin content had deteriorated, there was no trace of microbial growth and the 109-year-old food was determined to be still safe to eat.
A dye is a coloured substance that chemically bonds to the substrate to which it is being applied.
This distinguishes dyes from pigments which do not chemically bind to the material they colour.
The dye is generally applied in an aqueous solution , and may require a mordant to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber.
Both dyes and pigments are colored, because they absorb only some wavelengths of visible light .
Dyes are usually soluble in water whereas pigments are insoluble.
Some dyes can be rendered insoluble with the addition of salt to produce a lake pigment .
Beginning with the Industrial Revolution era, a workshop may be a room, rooms or building which provides both the area and tools (or machinery) that may be required for the manufacture or repair of manufactured goods.
Workshops were the only places of production until the advent of industrialization and the development of larger factories.
In the 20th and 21st century, many Western homes contain a workshop in the garage, basement, or an external shed.
Home workshops typically contain a workbench, hand tools, power tools and other hardware.
Along with their practical applications for repair goods or do small manufacturing runs, workshops are used to tinker and make prototypes.123
Beginning with the Industrial Revolution era, a workshop may be a room , rooms or building which provides both the area and tools (or machinery ) that may be required for the manufacture or repair of manufactured goods .

Home workshops typically contain a workbench, hand tools, power tools and other hardware.
Along with their practical applications for repair goods or do small manufacturing runs, workshops are used to tinker and make prototypes .
Workshops may vary in industrial focus.
For instance, some workshops may focus on automotive repair or restoration.
Woodworking is one of the most common focuses, but metalworking, electronics work, and many types of electronic prototyping may be done.
An invention is a unique or novel device , method, composition or process.
The invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process.
It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result.
An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough.
Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field .
An inventor may be taking a big step toward success or failure.
Some inventions can be patented.
A patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention.
The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary by country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.
Another meaning of invention is cultural invention , which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others.
The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books.
Invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity .
Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability.
Chocolate is a usually sweet, brown food preparation of roasted and ground cacao seeds that is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods.
The earliest evidence of use traces to the Olmecs (Mexico), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating to 1900 BC .
The majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs .
The word chocolate is derived from the Classical Nahuatl word chocolātl .
The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.
After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted.
The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass , unadulterated chocolate in rough form.
Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor .
The liquor also may be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter .
Baking chocolate , also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar .
Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than it contains cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa .
Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate , a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar.
Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk .
White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.
Chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts , including cakes , pudding , mousse , chocolate brownies , and chocolate chip cookies .
Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate.
Chocolate bars , either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks .
Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas , Easter , Valentine's Day , and Hanukkah .
Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate , and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao .
Although cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries , particularly Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana , are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.
With some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018.
However, international attempts to improve conditions for children were failing because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.
Distance is a numerical measurement of how far apart objects or points are.
In physics or everyday usage, distance may refer to a physical length or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. two counties over).
In most cases, distance from A to B is interchangeable with distance from B to A.
In mathematics , a distance function or metric is a generalization of the concept of physical distance.
A metric is a function that behaves according to a specific set of rules, and is a way of describing what it means for elements of some space to be close to or far away from each other.
The skeleton is the body part that forms the supporting structure of an organism .
It can also be seen as the bony frame work of the body which provides support, shape and protection to the soft tissues and delicate organs in animals.
There are several different skeletal types: the exoskeleton , which is the stable outer shell of an organism, the endoskeleton , which forms the support structure inside the body, the hydroskeleton , a flexible skeleton supported by fluid pressure, and the cytoskeleton present in the cytoplasm of all cells, including bacteria, and archaea.
The term comes from Greek σκελετός (skeletós) , meaning 'dried up'.
Civic is something being related to a city or municipality.
It also can refer to multiple other things:
A song is a musical composition intended to be sung by the human voice.
This is often done at distinct and fixed pitches using patterns of sound and silence.
Songs contain various forms , such as those including the repetition of sections.
Through semantic widening , a broader sense of the word song may refer to instrumentals .
Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics .
If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song .
Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants .
Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs .
Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs.
These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists.
Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances.
Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or, in some cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded).
Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas.
A song may be for a solo singer, a lead singer supported by background singers , a duet , trio , or larger ensemble involving more voices singing in harmony , although the term is generally not used for large classical music vocal forms including opera and oratorio , which use terms such as aria and recitative instead.
Songs with more than one voice to a part singing in polyphony or harmony are considered choral works.
Songs can be broadly divided into many different forms, depending on the criteria used.

These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists.
Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances.
Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or, in some cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded).
Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas.
A song may be for a solo singer, a lead singer supported by background singers , a duet , trio , or larger ensemble involving more voices singing in harmony , although the term is generally not used for large classical music vocal forms including opera and oratorio , which use terms such as aria and recitative instead.
Songs with more than one voice to a part singing in polyphony or harmony are considered choral works.
Songs can be broadly divided into many different forms, depending on the criteria used.
A forest is a large area dominated by trees .
Hundreds of more precise definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing and ecological function.
According to the widely used Food and Agriculture Organization definition, forests covered 4 billion hectares (9.9 × 10 acres) (15 million square miles) or approximately 30 percent of the world's land area in 2006.
Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth, and are distributed around the globe.
Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth's biosphere , and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass.
Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes carbon per year for tropical forests , 8.1 for temperate forests , and 2.6 for boreal forests .
Forests at different latitudes and elevations form distinctly different ecozones : boreal forests around the poles , tropical forests around the Equator , and temperate forests at the middle latitudes .
Higher elevation areas tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes, and amount of precipitation also affects forest composition.
Human society and forests influence each other in both positive and negative ways.
Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions.
Forests can also affect people's health.
Human activities, including harvesting forest resources, can negatively affect forest ecosystems.
The cheeks ( Latin : buccae ) constitute the area of the face below the eyes and between the nose and the left or right ear .
Buccal means relating to the cheek.
In humans, the region is innervated by the buccal nerve .
The area between the inside of the cheek and the teeth and gums is called the vestibule or buccal pouch or buccal cavity and forms part of the mouth .
In other animals the cheeks may also be referred to as jowls .
A gun is a ranged weapon typically designed to pneumatically discharge projectiles that are solid (most guns) but can also be liquid (as in water guns / cannons and projected water disruptors ) or even charged particles (as in a plasma gun ) and may be free-flying (as with bullets and artillery shells) or tethered (as with Taser guns , spearguns and harpoon guns ).
The means of projectile propulsion vary according to designs, but are traditionally effected by a high gas pressure contained within a shooting tube ( gun barrel ), produced either through the rapid combustion of propellants (as with firearms ), or by mechanical compression (as with air guns ).
The high-pressure gas is introduced behind the projectile, accelerating it down the length of the tube, imparting sufficient launch velocity to sustain its further travel towards the target once the propelling gas ceases acting upon it at the end of the tube.
Alternatively, acceleration via electromagnetic field generation may be employed, in which case the shooting tube may be substituted by guide rails (as in railguns ) or wrapped with magnetic coils (as in coilguns ).
The first devices identified as guns appeared in China from around CE 1000.
By the 12th century, the technology was spreading through the rest of Asia, and into Europe by the 13th century.
Autumn , also known as fall in American English and sometimes in Canadian English, is one of the four temperate seasons .
Autumn marks the transition from summer to winter , in September ( Northern Hemisphere ) or March ( Southern Hemisphere ), when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably.
One of its main features in temperate climates is the shedding of leaves from deciduous trees .
Some cultures regard the autumnal equinox as mid-autumn, while others with a longer temperature lag treat it as the start of autumn.
Meteorologists (and most of the temperate countries in the southern hemisphere) use a definition based on Gregorian calendar months, with autumn being September, October, and November in the northern hemisphere, and March, April, and May in the southern hemisphere.
In North America , autumn traditionally starts on September 21 and ends on December 21.
It is considered to start with the September equinox (21 to 24 September) and end with the winter solstice (21 or 22 December).
Popular culture in the United States associates Labor Day , the first Monday in September, as the end of summer and the start of autumn; certain summer traditions, such as wearing white, are discouraged after that date.
As daytime and nighttime temperatures decrease, trees shed their leaves.
In traditional East Asian solar term , autumn starts on or around 8 August and ends on or about 7 November.
In Ireland , the autumn months according to the national meteorological service, Met Éireann , are September, October and November.
However, according to the Irish Calendar , which is based on ancient Gaelic traditions, autumn lasts throughout the months of August, September and October, or possibly a few days later, depending on tradition.
The names of the months in Manx Gaelic are similarly based on autumn covering August, September and October.
In Argentina , Australia and New Zealand , autumn officially begins on 1 March and ends on 31 May.

The word lady is a term of respect for a girl or woman, the equivalent of gentleman .
Once used to describe only women of a high social class or status, the female equivalent of lord , now it may refer to any adult woman.
Informal use of this word is sometimes euphemistic (lady of the night for a prostitute ) or, in American slang , condescending (equivalent to mister or man).
Lady is also a formal title in the United Kingdom .
Lady is used before the family name of a woman with a title of nobility or honorary title suo jure (in her own right), or the wife of a lord , a baronet , laird , or a knight , and also before the first name of the daughter of a duke , marquess , or earl .
A warrior is a person specializing in combat or warfare , especially within the context of a tribal or clan -based warrior culture society that recognizes a separate warrior class or caste .
A highway is any public or private road or other public way on land.
It is used for major roads, but also includes other public roads and public tracks: It is not an equivalent term to controlled-access highway , or a translation for autobahn , autoroute , etc.
According to Merriam Webster , the use of the term predates 12th century.
According to Etymonline , high is in the sense of main.
In North American and Australian English , major roads such as controlled-access highways or arterial roads are often state highways (Canada: provincial highways ).
Other roads may be designated county highways in the US and Ontario .
These classifications refer to the level of government (state, provincial, county) that maintains the roadway.
In British English , highway is primarily a legal term.
Everyday use normally implies roads, while the legal use covers any route or path with a public right of access, including footpaths etc.
The term has led to several related derived terms, including highway system , highway code , highway patrol and highwayman .
Waves most often refers to:
Waves may also refer to:
A salary is a form of payment from an employer to an employee, which may be specified in an employment contract .
It is contrasted with piece wages , where each job, hour or other unit is paid separately, rather than on a periodic basis.From the point of view of running a business, salary can also be viewed as the cost of acquiring and retaining human resources for running operations, and is then termed personnel expense or salary expense.
In accounting, salaries are recorded on payroll accounts.
Salary is a fixed amount of money or compensation paid to an employee by an employer in return for work performed.
Salary is commonly paid in fixed intervals, for example, monthly payments of one-twelfth of the annual salary.
Salary is typically determined by comparing market pay rates for people performing similar work in similar industries in the same region.
Salary is also determined by leveling the pay rates and salary ranges established by an individual employer.
Salary is also affected by the number of people available to perform the specific job in the employer's employment locale.
Futures may mean:
A conditioner is something that improves the quality of another material.
Conditioner may more specifically refer to:
Pilot or The Pilot may refer to:
A tower is a tall structure , taller than it is wide, often by a significant margin.
Towers are distinguished from masts by their lack of guy-wires and are therefore, along with tall buildings, self-supporting structures.
Towers are specifically distinguished from buildings in that they are not built to be habitable but to serve other functions.
The principal function is the use of their height to enable various functions to be achieved including: visibility of other features attached to the tower such as clock towers ; as part of a larger structure or device to increase the visibility of the surroundings for defensive purposes as in a fortified building such as a castle ; as a structure for observation for leisure purposes; or as a structure for telecommunication purposes.
Towers can be stand alone structures or be supported by adjacent buildings or can be a feature on top of a large structure or building.
Jan , JaN or JAN may refer to:
Iron ( ) is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin : ferrum ) and atomic number 26.
It is a metal , that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table .
It is by mass the most common element on Earth , forming much of Earth's outer and inner core .
It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust .
Pure iron is very rare on the Earth's crust, basically being limited to meteorites .
Iron ores are quite abundant, but extracting usable metal from them requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1500 °C or higher, about 500 °C higher than what is enough to smelt copper .
Humans started to dominate that process in Eurasia only about 2000 BCE , and iron began to displace copper alloys for tools and weapons, in some regions, only around 1200 BCE.
That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age .
Iron alloys, such as steel , inox , and special steels are now by far the most common industrial metals, because of their mechanical properties and their low cost.
Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray.
However, iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides , commonly known as rust .
Unlike the oxides of some other metals, that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.
The body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin .
These two proteins play essential roles in vertebrate metabolism , respectively oxygen transport by blood and oxygen storage in muscles .
To maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet.
Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.
Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III) .
Iron shares many properties of other transition metals , including the other group 8 elements , ruthenium and osmium .
Iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states , −2 to +7.
Iron also forms many coordination compounds ; some of them, such as ferrocene , ferrioxalate , and Prussian blue , have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.
Mobile may refer to:
Target may refer to:
Failure is the state or condition of not meeting a desirable or intended objective , and may be viewed as the opposite of success .
Product failure ranges from failure to sell the product to fracture of the product, in the worst cases leading to personal injury, the province of forensic engineering .
Track or Tracks may refer to:
Livestock is commonly defined as domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce labor and commodities such as meat , eggs , milk , fur , leather , and wool .
The term is sometimes used to refer solely to those that are bred for consumption, while other times it refers only to farmed ruminants , such as cattle and goats .
Horses are considered livestock in the United States.
The USDA classifies pork, veal, beef, and lamb as livestock and all livestock as red meat.
Poultry and fish are not included in the category.
The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of livestock, known as animal husbandry , is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles.
Animal husbandry practices have varied widely across cultures and time periods, and continues to play a major economic and cultural role in numerous communities.
Livestock farming practices have largely shifted to intensive animal farming , sometimes referred to as factory farming; over 99% of livestock in the US are now raised in this way.
Intensive animal farming increases the yield of the various commercial outputs, but has also led to negative impacts on animal welfare , the environment , and public health .
The Ministry for State Security ( German : Ministerium für Staatssicherheit , MfS) or State Security Service ( Staatssicherheitsdienst , SSD), commonly known as the Stasi ( IPA: ˈʃtaːziː ), was the official state security service of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).
It has been described as one of the most effective and repressive intelligence and secret police agencies ever to have existed.
The Stasi was headquartered in East Berlin , with an extensive complex in Berlin-Lichtenberg and several smaller facilities throughout the city.
The Stasi motto was Schild und Schwert der Partei (Shield and Sword of the Party), referring to the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany ( Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands , SED) and also echoing a theme of the KGB , the Soviet counterpart and close partner, with respect to its own ruling party, the CPSU .
Erich Mielke was the Stasi's longest-serving chief, in power for thirty-two of the GDR's forty years of existence.
One of its main tasks was spying on the population, mainly through a vast network of citizens turned informants, and fighting any opposition by overt and covert measures, including hidden psychological destruction of dissidents ( Zersetzung , literally meaning decomposition ).
Its Main Directorate for Reconnaissance ( Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung ) was responsible for both espionage and for conducting covert operations in foreign countries.
Under its long-time head Markus Wolf , this directorate gained a reputation as one of the most effective intelligence agencies of the Cold War .
The Stasi also maintained contacts, and occasionally cooperated, with Western terrorists.
Numerous Stasi officials were prosecuted for their crimes after 1990.
After German reunification , the surveillance files that the Stasi had maintained on millions of East Germans were laid open, so that any citizen could inspect their personal file on request; these files are now maintained by the Stasi Records Agency .
A month is a unit of time , used with calendars , which is approximately as long as a natural period related to the motion of the Moon ; month and Moon are cognates .
The traditional concept arose with the cycle of Moon phases ; such months ( lunations ) are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days .
From excavated tally sticks , researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age.
Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth-Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year .
Paternalism is action that limits a person's or group's liberty or autonomy and is intended to promote their own good.
Paternalism can also imply that the behavior is against or regardless of the will of a person, or also that the behavior expresses an attitude of superiority.
Paternalism, paternalistic and paternalist have all been used as a pejorative .
The word paternalism is from the Latin pater father via the adjective paternus fatherly, which in Medieval Latin became paternalis .
Some, such as John Stuart Mill , think paternalism to be appropriate towards children: saying of liberty It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties.
We are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood.
Paternalism towards adults is sometimes thought of as treating them as if they were children.
Birds , also known as Aves or avian dinosaurs , are a group of endothermic vertebrates , characterised by feathers , toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart , and a strong yet lightweight skeleton .
Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich .
They rank as the world's most numerically-successful class of tetrapods , with approximately ten thousand living species, more than half of these being passerines , sometimes known as perching birds.
Birds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds .
Wings, which evolved from forelimbs , gave birds the ability to fly , although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in flightless birds , including ratites , penguins , and diverse endemic island species of birds .
The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight.
Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds , have further evolved for swimming .
The fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs , having evolved from earlier feathered dinosaurs within the theropod group, which are traditionally placed within the saurischian dinosaurs.
The closest living relatives of birds are the crocodilians .
Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae , have been found dating back to the mid- Jurassic period, around 170 million years ago.
Many of these early stem-birds, such as Archaeopteryx , retained primitive characteristics such as teeth and long bony tails.
DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago, which killed off the pterosaurs and all the non-avian dinosaur lineages.
But birds, especially those in the southern continents, survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while diversifying during periods of global cooling.
This makes them the sole surviving dinosaurs according to cladistics .
Some birds, especially corvids and parrots , are among the most intelligent animals ; several bird species make and use tools , and many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture .
Many species annually migrate great distances.
Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs , and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking , and mobbing of predators.
The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous (referring to social living arrangement, distinct from genetic monogamy), usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life.
Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (arrangement of one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (arrangement of one female with many males).
Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction .
They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents.
Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.
Some birds, such as hens , lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised eggs do not produce offspring.
Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds ( poultry and game ) being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers.
Songbirds , parrots, and other species are popular as pets.
Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser .
Birds prominently figure throughout human culture.
About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then.
Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them.
Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.
A fisherman or fisher is someone who captures fish and other animals from a body of water, or gathers shellfish .
Worldwide, there are about 38 million commercial and subsistence fishermen and fish farmers .
Fishermen may be professional or recreational and may be both men or women.
Fishing has existed as a means of obtaining food since the Mesolithic period.
Tuberculosis ( TB ) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria .
Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs , but can also affect other parts of the body.
Most infections do not have symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis .
About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those affected.
The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing mucus , fever , night sweats , and weight loss .
It was historically called consumption due to the weight loss.
Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.
Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough , spit, speak, or sneeze .
People with latent TB do not spread the disease.
Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke .
Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays , as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids.
Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.
Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine.
Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB.
Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time.
Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).
Presently, one-quarter of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB.
New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year.
In 2017, there were more than 10 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.6 million deaths.
This makes it the number one cause of death from an infectious disease.
More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries , and more than 50% in India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines.
The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000.
About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 5–10% of people in the United States population test positive by the tuberculin test.
Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times .
Smuggling is the illegal transportation of objects, substances, information or people, such as out of a house or buildings, into a prison , or across an international border , in violation of applicable laws or other regulations.
There are various motivations to smuggle.
These include the participation in illegal trade, such as in the drug trade , illegal weapons trade , exotic wildlife trade , illegal immigration or illegal emigration , tax evasion , providing contraband to a prison inmate, or the theft of the items being smuggled.
Smuggling is a common theme in literature , from Bizet 's opera Carmen to the James Bond spy books (and later films) Diamonds are Forever and Goldfinger .
Pride is an inwardly directed emotional term that carries two antithetical meanings.
With a negative connotation pride refers to a foolishly and irrationally corrupt sense of one's personal value, status or accomplishments, used synonymously with hubris .
In Judaism, pride is called the root of all evil.
With a positive connotation, pride refers to a humble and content sense of attachment toward one's own or another's choices and actions, or toward a whole group of people , and is a product of praise , independent self-reflection , and a fulfilled feeling of belonging .
Philosophers and social psychologists have noted that pride is a complex secondary emotion which requires the development of a sense of self and the mastery of relevant conceptual distinctions (e.g. that pride is distinct from happiness and joy) through language-based interaction with others.
Some social psychologists identify the nonverbal expression of pride as a means of sending a functional, automatically perceived signal of high social status.
In contrast, pride could also be defined as a lowly disagreement with the truth.
One definition of pride in the former sense comes from St. Augustine : the love of one's own excellence.
A similar definition comes from Meher Baba : Pride is the specific feeling through which egoism manifests.
Pride is sometimes viewed as corrupt or as a vice , sometimes as proper or as a virtue .
While some philosophers such as Aristotle (and George Bernard Shaw ) consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world religions consider pride's fraudulent form a sin , such as is expressed in Proverbs 11:2 of the Hebrew Bible .
When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known as virtuous pride, greatness of soul or magnanimity , but when viewed as a vice it is often known to be self- idolatry , sadistic contempt, vanity or vainglory.
Pride can also manifest itself as a high opinion of one's nation (national pride) and ethnicity (ethnic pride).
Steve is a masculine given name, usually a short form ( hypocorism ) of Stephen or Steven.
It may refer to:
A college ( Latin : collegium ) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one.
A college may be a degree -awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university , an institution offering vocational education or a secondary school.
In the United States , college may refer to a constituent part of a university or to a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, but generally college and university are used interchangeably, whereas in the United Kingdom , Oceania , South Asia , Southern Africa and Canada , college may refer to a secondary or high school, a college of further education , a training institution that awards trade qualifications, a higher education provider that does not have university status (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university (See this comparison of British and American English educational terminology for further information).
Kim or KIM may refer to:
Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties.
Those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates .
The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC, when the Sea Peoples , a group of ocean raiders, attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilizations.
Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy, as well as for privateering and commerce raiding .
Historic examples include the waters of Gibraltar , the Strait of Malacca , Madagascar, the Gulf of Aden , and the English Channel, whose geographic structures facilitated pirate attacks.
A land-based parallel is the ambushing of travelers by bandits and brigands in highways and mountain passes.
Privateering uses similar methods to piracy, but the captain acts under orders of the state authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation, making it a legitimate form of war -like activity by non-state actors .
While the term can include acts committed in the air , on land (especially across national borders or in connection with taking over and robbing a car or train ), or in other major bodies of water or on a shore , in cyberspace , as well as the fictional possibility of space piracy, this article focuses on maritime piracy.
It does not normally include crimes committed against people traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator (e.g. one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel).
Piracy or pirating is the name of a specific crime under customary international law and also the name of a number of crimes under the municipal law of a number of states.
In the early 21st century , seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue (with estimated worldwide losses of US$16 billion per year in 2004), particularly in the waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean , off the Somali coast , and also in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore .
Today, pirates armed with automatic weapons, such as assault rifles , and machine guns , grenades and rocket propelled grenades use small motorboats to attack and board ships, a tactic that takes advantage of the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels and transport ships.
They also use larger vessels, known as mother ships, to supply the smaller motorboats.
The international community is facing many challenges in bringing modern pirates to justice , as these attacks often occur in international waters .
Some nations have used their naval forces to protect private ships from pirate attacks and to pursue pirates, and some private vessels use armed security guards, high-pressure water cannons , or sound cannons to repel boarders, and use radar to avoid potential threats.

Ray may refer to:
An army (from Latin arma arms, weapons via Old French armée , armed feminine) or land force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land.
In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch , service branch or armed service of a nation or state.
It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component.
In certain states, the term army refers to the entire armed forces (e.g., People's Liberation Army).
Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army .
In several countries, the army is officially called the Land Army to differentiate it from an air force called the Air Army , notably France .
In such countries, the word army on its own retains its connotation of a land force in common usage.
The current largest army in the world, by number of active troops, is the People's Liberation Army Ground Force of China with 1,600,000 active troops and 510,000 reserve personnel followed by the Indian Army with 1,129,000 active troops and 960,000 reserve personnel.
By convention, irregular military is understood in contrast to regular armies which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite militia .
Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc.
Regular military can also refer to full-time status ( standing army ), versus reserve or part-time personnel.
Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the National Defence Act ), from de facto non-statutory forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies.
Armies may also be expeditionary (designed for overseas or international deployment) or fencible (designed for – or restricted to – homeland defence)
The Quran ( kor- AHN ; Arabic : القرآن ‎, romanized : al-Qurʼān Arabic pronunciation: alqur'ʔaːn , literally meaning the recitation; also romanized Qur'an or Koran ) is the central religious text of Islam , which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God ( Allah ).
It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature .
The Quran is divided into chapters (Arabic: سورة sūrah , plural سور suwar ), which are subdivided into verses (Arabic: آية āyah , plural آيات āyāt ).
Muslims believe that the Quran was orally revealed by God to the final Prophet, Muhammad , through the archangel Gabriel ( Jibril ), incrementally over a period of some 23 years, beginning on 22 December 609 CE , when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632, the year of his death.
Muslims regard the Quran as Muhammad's most important miracle, a proof of his prophethood, and the culmination of a series of divine messages starting with those revealed to Adam and ending with Muhammad.
The word Quran occurs some 70 times in the Quran's text, and other names and words are also said to refer to the Quran.
According to tradition, several of Muhammad's companions served as scribes and recorded the revelations.
Shortly after his death, the Quran was compiled by the companions, who had written down or memorized parts of it.
The codices showed differences that motivated Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version, now known as Uthman's codex, which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today.
There are, however, variant readings , with mostly minor differences in meaning.
The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures .
It summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events.
The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance for mankind 2:185 .
It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.
Hadith are additional oral and written traditions supplementing the Quran; from careful authentication they are believed to describe words and actions of Muhammad, and in some traditions also those closest to him.
In most denominations of Islam, the Quran is used together with hadith to interpret sharia (Islamic) law ; in a small number of denominations, only the Quran is used as a source, an approach called Quranism .
During prayers, the Quran is recited only in Arabic.
Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz .
Quranic verse ( ayah ) is sometimes recited with a special kind of elocution reserved for this purpose, called tajwid .
During the month of Ramadan , Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers.
In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse, most Muslims rely on exegesis , or tafsir .
The domestic dog ( Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids , and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore .
The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated , which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct .
The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species.
Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors.
They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting , herding , pulling loads , protection , assisting police and military , companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles.
This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of man's best friend .
An atmosphere (from Ancient Greek ἀτμός (atmos) , meaning 'vapour', and σφαῖρα (sphaira) , meaning 'ball' or 'sphere' ) is a layer or a set of layers of gases surrounding a planet or other material body , that is held in place by the gravity of that body.
An atmosphere is more likely to be retained if the gravity it is subject to is high and the temperature of the atmosphere is low.
The atmosphere of Earth is composed of nitrogen (about 78%), oxygen (about 21%), argon (about 0.9%), carbon dioxide (0.04%) and other gases in trace amounts.
Oxygen is used by most organisms for respiration ; nitrogen is fixed by bacteria and lightning to produce ammonia used in the construction of nucleotides and amino acids ; and carbon dioxide is used by plants , algae and cyanobacteria for photosynthesis .
The atmosphere helps to protect living organisms from genetic damage by solar ultraviolet radiation , solar wind and cosmic rays .
The current composition of the Earth's atmosphere is the product of billions of years of biochemical modification of the paleoatmosphere by living organisms.
The term stellar atmosphere describes the outer region of a star and typically includes the portion above the opaque photosphere .
Stars with sufficiently low temperatures may have outer atmospheres with compound molecules .
A bathtub , bath , or tub (informal) is a large or small container for holding water in which a person or animal may bathe .
Most modern bathtubs are made of thermoformed acrylic , porcelain enameled steel , fiberglass -reinforced polyester , or porcelain enameled cast iron .
A bathtub is usually placed in a bathroom either as a stand-alone fixture or in conjunction with a shower .
Modern bathtubs have overflow and waste drains and may have taps mounted on them.
They are usually built-in, but may be free-standing or sometimes sunken.
Until recently, most bathtubs were roughly rectangular in shape, but with the advent of acrylic thermoformed baths, more shapes are becoming available.
Bathtubs are commonly white in colour, although many other colours can be found.
The process for enamelling cast iron bathtubs was invented by the Scottish-born American David Dunbar Buick .
Two main styles of bathtub are common:
Event may refer to:
An artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts , or demonstrating an art.
The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only.
The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors).
Artiste (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context; this use is becoming rare.
Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.
In anthropology , a tribe is a human social group .
Exact definitions of what constitutes a tribe vary among anthropologists.
The concept is often contrasted with other social groups concepts, such as nations , states , and forms of kinship .
In some places, such as India and North America , tribes are polities that have been granted legal recognition and limited autonomy by the national or federal government.
A priest or priestess is a religious leader authorized to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities.
They also have the authority or power to administer religious rites ; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a deity or deities.
Their office or position is the priesthood , a term which also may apply to such persons collectively.
Site most often refers to:
It may also refer to:
A sense is a physiological capacity of organisms that provides data for perception .
The senses and their operation, classification, and theory are overlapping topics studied by a variety of fields, most notably neuroscience , cognitive psychology (or cognitive science ), and philosophy of perception .
The nervous system has a specific sensory nervous system , and a sense organ , or sensor , dedicated to each sense.
Humans have a multitude of sensors.
Sight ( vision , visual sense), hearing ( audition , auditory sense), taste ( gustation , gustatory sense), smell ( olfaction , olfactory sense), and touch ( somatosensation , somatosensory sense) are the five traditionally recognized senses.
The ability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by these most broadly recognized senses also exists, and these sensory modalities include temperature ( thermoception ), kinesthetic sense ( proprioception ), pain ( nociception ), balance ( equilibrioception ), vibration ( mechanoreception ), and various internal stimuli (e.g. the different chemoreceptors for detecting salt and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood, or sense of hunger and sense of thirst ).
However, what constitutes a sense is a matter of some debate, leading to difficulties in defining what exactly a distinct sense is, and where the borders lie between responses to related stimuli.
Other animals also have receptors to sense the world around them, with degrees of capability varying greatly between species.
Humans have a comparatively weak sense of smell and a stronger sense of sight relative to many other mammals while some animals may lack one or more of the traditional five senses.
Some animals may also intake and interpret sensory stimuli in very different ways.
Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way that humans cannot, with some species able to sense electrical and magnetic fields , and detect water pressure and currents.
A road is a thoroughfare , route, or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some form of conveyance , including a motor vehicle , cart, bicycle, or horse.
Roads consist of one or two roadways ( British English : carriageways), each with one or more lanes and any associated sidewalks (British English: pavement) and road verges .
There is sometimes a bike path .
Other names for roads include parkways, avenues, freeways, tollways, interstates, highways, or primary, secondary, and tertiary local roads.
Perspiration , also known as sweating , is the production of fluids secreted by the sweat glands in the skin of mammals .
Two types of sweat glands can be found in humans: eccrine glands and apocrine glands .
The eccrine sweat glands are distributed over much of the body.
In humans , sweating is primarily a means of thermoregulation , which is achieved by the water-rich secretion of the eccrine glands.
Maximum sweat rates of an adult can be up to 2–4 liters per hour or 10–14 liters per day (10–15 g/minm ), but is less in children prior to puberty.
Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface has a cooling effect due to evaporative cooling .
Hence, in hot weather, or when the individual's muscles heat up due to exertion, more sweat is produced.
Animals with few sweat glands, such as dogs , accomplish similar temperature regulation results by panting, which evaporates water from the moist lining of the oral cavity and pharynx .
Although sweating is found in a wide variety of mammals, relatively few (exceptions include humans and horses) produce large amounts of sweat in order to cool down.
Distance is a numerical measurement of how far apart objects or points are.
In physics or everyday usage, distance may refer to a physical length or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. two counties over).
In most cases, distance from A to B is interchangeable with distance from B to A.
In mathematics , a distance function or metric is a generalization of the concept of physical distance.
A metric is a function that behaves according to a specific set of rules, and is a way of describing what it means for elements of some space to be close to or far away from each other.
SD may refer to:
A restaurant ( French: ʁɛstoʁɑ̃ ( listen ) ), or an eatery , is a business which prepares and serves food and drinks to customers in exchange for money .
Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises , but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services .
Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias , to mid-priced family restaurants , to high-priced luxury establishments.
In Western countries, most mid- to high-range restaurants serve alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine .
Some restaurants serve all the major meals, such as breakfast , lunch , and dinner (e.g., major fast food chains, diners, hotel restaurants, and airport restaurants).
Other restaurants may serve only a single meal (for example, a pancake house may only serve breakfast) or they may serve two meals (e.g., lunch and dinner).
Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from about one meter to one millimeter; with frequencies between 300 MHz (1 m) and 300 GHz (1 mm).
Different sources define different frequency ranges as microwaves; the above broad definition includes both UHF and EHF ( millimeter wave ) bands.
A more common definition in radio engineering is the range between 1 and 100 GHz (wavelengths between 0.3 m and 3 mm).
In all cases, microwaves include the entire SHF band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum.
Frequencies in the microwave range are often referred to by their IEEE radar band designations: S , C , X , K u , K , or K a band , or by similar NATO or EU designations.
The prefix micro- in microwave is not meant to suggest a wavelength in the micrometer range.
Rather, it indicates that microwaves are small (having shorter wavelengths), compared to the radio waves used prior to microwave technology.
The boundaries between far infrared , terahertz radiation , microwaves, and ultra-high-frequency radio waves are fairly arbitrary and are used variously between different fields of study.
Microwaves travel by line-of-sight ; unlike lower frequency radio waves they do not diffract around hills, follow the earth's surface as ground waves , or reflect from the ionosphere , so terrestrial microwave communication links are limited by the visual horizon to about 40 miles (64 km).
At the high end of the band they are absorbed by gases in the atmosphere, limiting practical communication distances to around a kilometer.
Microwaves are widely used in modern technology, for example in point-to-point communication links, wireless networks , microwave radio relay networks, radar , satellite and spacecraft communication , medical diathermy and cancer treatment, remote sensing , radio astronomy , particle accelerators , spectroscopy , industrial heating, collision avoidance systems , garage door openers and keyless entry systems , and for cooking food in microwave ovens .
Land , sometimes referred to as dry land , is the solid surface of Earth that is not permanently covered by water .
The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture , habitat , and various natural resources .
Some life forms (including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals ) have developed from predecessor species that lived in bodies of water .
Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones .
The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans.
The demarcation between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors.
A maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation.
A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land.
Solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun.
Demarcation can further vary due to tides and weather.
Ivory is a hard, white material from the tusks (traditionally elephants') and teeth of animals, that consists mainly of dentine , one of the physical structures of teeth and tusks.
The chemical structure of the teeth and tusks of mammals is the same, regardless of the species of origin.
The trade in certain teeth and tusks other than elephant is well established and widespread; therefore, ivory can correctly be used to describe any mammalian teeth or tusks of commercial interest which are large enough to be carved or scrimshawed .
It has been valued since ancient times in art or manufacturing for making a range of items from ivory carvings to false teeth , piano keys , fans, dominoes and joint tubes.
Elephant ivory is the most important source, but ivory from mammoth , walrus , hippopotamus , sperm whale , killer whale , narwhal and wart hog are used as well.
Elk also have two ivory teeth, which are believed to be the remnants of tusks from their ancestors.
The national and international trade in ivory of threatened species such as African and Asian elephants is illegal.
The word ivory ultimately derives from the ancient Egyptian âb, âbu (elephant), through the Latin ebor- or ebur .
Asphalt , also known as bitumen ( UK : , US : ), is a sticky, black, and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum .
It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product, and is classed as a pitch .
Before the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used.
The word is derived from the Ancient Greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos .
The primary use (70%) of asphalt is in road construction , where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete .
Its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products, including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs.
The terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance.
In American English , asphalt (or asphalt cement) is commonly used for a refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils.
Outside the United States, the product is often called bitumen, and geologists worldwide often prefer the term for the naturally occurring variety.
Common colloquial usage often refers to various forms of asphalt as tar , as in the name of the La Brea Tar Pits .
Naturally occurring asphalt is sometimes specified by the term crude bitumen.
Its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling at 525 °C (977 °F) is sometimes referred to as refined bitumen.
The Canadian province of Alberta has most of the world's reserves of natural asphalt in the Athabasca oil sands , which cover 142,000 square kilometres (55,000 sq mi), an area larger than England .
Kale ( ) or leaf cabbage is one of certain cultivars of cabbage ( Brassica oleracea ) grown for their edible leaves , although some are used as ornamentals .
Kale plants have green or purple leaves, and the central leaves do not form a head (as with headed cabbage ).
Kales are considered to be closer to wild cabbage than most of the many domesticated forms of Brassica oleracea .
An office is generally a room or other area where an organization's employees perform administrative work in order to support and realize objects and goals of the organization.
The word office may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it (see officer , office-holder , official ); the latter is in fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one's duty.
When used as an adjective , the term office may refer to business -related tasks.
In law , a company or organization has offices in any place where it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of (for example) a storage silo rather than an establishment with desk -and- chair .
An office is also an architectural and design phenomenon: ranging from a small office such as a bench in the corner of a small business of extremely small size (see small office/home office ), through entire floors of buildings, up to and including massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company.
In modern terms an office is usually the location where white-collar workers carry out their functions.
As per James Stephenson , Office is that part of business enterprise which is devoted to the direction and co-ordination of its various activities.
Offices in classical antiquity were often part of a palace complex or of a large temple.
The High Middle Ages (1000–1300) saw the rise of the medieval chancery , which was usually the place where most government letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of a kingdom.
With the growth of large, complex organizations in the 18th century, the first purpose-built office spaces were constructed.
As the Industrial Revolution intensified in the 18th and 19th centuries, the industries of banking , rail , insurance , retail , petroleum , and telegraphy grew dramatically, requiring a large number of clerks, and as a result more office space was assigned to house their activities.
The time-and-motion study , pioneered in manufacturing by F.
Taylor (1856-1915) led to the Modern Efficiency Desk of 1915 with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers.
However, by the middle of the 20th century, it became apparent that an efficient office required discretion in the control of privacy , and gradually the cubicle system evolved.
The main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their jobs.
Work spaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing and computer work.
There are nine generic types of work space, each supporting different activities.
In addition to individual cubicles, one can find meeting rooms , lounges , and spaces for support activities, such as photocopying and filing.
Some offices also have a kitchen area where workers can make their lunches.
There are many different ways of arranging the space in an office and whilst these vary according to function, managerial fashions and the culture of specific companies can be even more important.
While offices can be built in almost any location and in almost any building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult, such as requirements for light, networking, and security.
The major purpose of an office building is to provide a workplace and working environment - primarily for administrative and managerial workers.
These workers usually occupy set areas within the office building, and usually are provided with desks, PCs and other equipment they may need within these areas.
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit .
These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.
Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay .
Mining is required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through agricultural processes, or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory.
Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water .
Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times.
Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies, analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine, extraction of the desired materials, and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed.
De Re Metallica, Georgius Agricola, 1550, Book I, Para.
Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact, both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed.
Hence, most of the world's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact.
Work safety has long been a concern as well, and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines.
Levels of metal recycling are generally low.
Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up, some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products.
Due to the low recycling rates, some landfills now contain higher concentrations of metal than mines themselves.
Enterprise (or the archaic spelling Enterprize ) may refer to:
A farmer (also called an agriculturer ) is a person engaged in agriculture , raising living organisms for food or raw materials.
The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops , orchards , vineyards , poultry , or other livestock .
A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a laborer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands.
However, in the not so distant past, a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish).
In botany , a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk , supporting branches and leaves in most species.
In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth , plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height.
In wider definitions, the taller palms , tree ferns , bananas , and bamboos are also trees.
Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight.
Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old.
Trees have been in existence for 370 million years.
It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.
A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk.
This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another.
For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier.
Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil.
Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots.
The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis , providing the food for the tree's growth and development.
Trees usually reproduce using seeds.
Flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones.
Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce spores instead.
Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate .
They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues.
Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants.
Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world.
Trees provide shade and shelter , timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses.
In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture.
Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies .
Specimen may refer to:
An aircraft is a Vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air .
It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil , or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines .
Common examples of aircraft include airplanes , helicopters , airships (including blimps ), gliders , paramotors and hot air balloons .
The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation .
The science of aviation, including designing and building aircraft, is called aeronautics .
Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot , but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers .
Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, aircraft propulsion , usage and others.
A son is a male offspring ; a boy or man in relation to his parents .
The female counterpart is a daughter .
From a biological perspective, a son constitutes a first degree relative .
In psychology, frustration is a common emotional response to opposition, related to anger , annoyance and disappointment , frustration arises from the perceived resistance to the fulfillment of an individual's will or goal and is likely to increase when a will or goal is denied or blocked.
There are two types of frustration; internal and external.
Internal frustration may arise from challenges in fulfilling personal goals , desires , instinctual drives and needs, or dealing with perceived deficiencies , such as a lack of confidence or fear of social situations.
Conflict , such as when one has competing goals that interfere with one another, can also be an internal source of frustration and can create cognitive dissonance .
External causes of frustration involve conditions outside an individual's control, such as a physical roadblock, a difficult task, or the perception of wasting time.
There are multiple ways individuals cope with frustration such as passive–aggressive behavior , anger , or violence, although frustration may also propel positive processes via enhanced effort and strive.
This broad range of potential outcomes makes it difficult to identify the original cause(s) of frustration, as the responses may be indirect.
However, a more direct and common response is a propensity towards aggression.
Doctor or The Doctor may refer to:
Hearing loss , also known as hearing impairment , is a partial or total inability to hear .
A deaf person has little to no hearing.
Hearing loss may occur in one or both ears.
In children, hearing problems can affect the ability to learn spoken language and in adults it can create difficulties with social interaction and at work.
In some people, particularly older people, hearing loss can result in loneliness.
Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent.
Hearing loss may be caused by a number of factors, including: genetics , ageing , exposure to noise , some infections , birth complications, trauma to the ear, and certain medications or toxins.
A common condition that results in hearing loss is chronic ear infections .
Certain infections during pregnancy, such as cytomegalovirus , syphilis and rubella , may also cause hearing loss in the child.
Hearing loss is diagnosed when hearing testing finds that a person is unable to hear 25 decibels in at least one ear.
Testing for poor hearing is recommended for all newborns.
Hearing loss can be categorized as mild (25 to 40 dB ), moderate (41 to 55 dB), moderate-severe (56 to 70 dB), severe (71 to 90 dB), or profound (greater than 90 dB).
There are three main types of hearing loss: conductive hearing loss , sensorineural hearing loss , and mixed hearing loss.
About half of hearing loss globally is preventable through public health measures.
Such practices include immunization , proper care around pregnancy , avoiding loud noise, and avoiding certain medications.
The World Health Organization recommends that young people limit the use of personal audio players to an hour a day in an effort to limit exposure to noise.
Early identification and support are particularly important in children.
For many hearing aids , sign language , cochlear implants and subtitles are useful.
Lip reading is another useful skill some develop.
Access to hearing aids, however, is limited in many areas of the world.
As of 2013 hearing loss affects about 1.1 billion people to some degree.
It causes disability in 5% (360 to 538 million) and moderate to severe disability in 124 million people.
Of those with moderate to severe disability 108 million live in low and middle income countries.
Of those with hearing loss, it began during childhood for 65 million.
Those who use sign language and are members of Deaf culture see themselves as having a difference rather than an illness.
Most members of Deaf culture oppose attempts to cure deafness and some within this community view cochlear implants with concern as they have the potential to eliminate their culture.
The term hearing impairment is often viewed negatively as it emphasises what people cannot do.
A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles.
The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock , such as sand , gravel , shingle , pebbles .
The particles can also be biological in origin, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae .
Some beaches have man-made infrastructure, such as lifeguard posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks and bars.
They may also have hospitality venues (such as resorts, camps, hotels, and restaurants) nearby.
Wild beaches, also known as undeveloped or undiscovered beaches, are not developed in this manner.
Wild beaches can be appreciated for their untouched beauty and preserved nature.
Beaches typically occur in areas along the coast where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments.
Asphalt , also known as bitumen ( UK : , US : ), is a sticky, black, and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum .
It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product, and is classed as a pitch .
Before the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used.
The word is derived from the Ancient Greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos .
The primary use (70%) of asphalt is in road construction , where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete .
Its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products, including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs.

Outside the United States, the product is often called bitumen, and geologists worldwide often prefer the term for the naturally occurring variety.
Common colloquial usage often refers to various forms of asphalt as tar , as in the name of the La Brea Tar Pits .
Naturally occurring asphalt is sometimes specified by the term crude bitumen.
Its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling at 525 °C (977 °F) is sometimes referred to as refined bitumen.
The Canadian province of Alberta has most of the world's reserves of natural asphalt in the Athabasca oil sands , which cover 142,000 square kilometres (55,000 sq mi), an area larger than England .
An envelope is a common packaging item, usually made of thin, flat material.
It is designed to contain a flat object, such as a letter or card .
Traditional envelopes are made from sheets of paper cut to one of three shapes: a rhombus , a short-arm cross or a kite.
These shapes allow for the creation of the envelope structure by folding the sheet sides around a central rectangular area.
In this manner, a rectangle-faced enclosure is formed with an arrangement of four flaps on the reverse side.
A coffeehouse , coffee shop , or café is an establishment that primarily serves coffee , related coffee drinks ( latte , cappuccino , espresso ), and – depending on country – other drinks including alcoholic.
Some coffeehouses may serve cold drinks such as iced coffee and iced tea ; in continental Europe , cafés serve alcoholic drinks.
A coffeehouse may also serve some type of food, such as light snacks , sandwiches , muffins or other pastries .
Coffeehouses range from owner-operated small businesses to large multinational corporations.
Some coffeehouses are franchise based business models, with numerous branches across various countries all around the world.
While café may refer to a coffeehouse, the term cafe generally refers to a diner , British cafe (colloquially called a caff), greasy spoon (a small and inexpensive restaurant), transport cafe , teahouse or tea room , or other casual eating and drinking place.
A coffeehouse may share some of the same characteristics of a bar or restaurant , but it is different from a cafeteria .
Many coffeehouses in the Middle East and in West Asian immigrant districts in the Western world offer shisha ( nargile in Greek and Turkish), flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah .
Espresso bars are a type of coffeehouse that specializes in serving espresso and espresso-based drinks.
From a cultural standpoint, coffeehouses largely serve as centers of social interaction: the coffeehouse provides patrons with a place to congregate, talk, read, write, entertain one another, or pass the time, whether individually or in small groups.
Since the development of Wi-Fi , coffeehouses with this capability have also become places for patrons to access the Internet on their laptops and tablet computers .
A coffeehouse can serve as an informal club for its regular members.
As early as the 1950s Beatnik era and the 1960s folk music scene, coffeehouses have hosted singer-songwriter performances, typically in the evening.
In religion , divinity or Godhead is the state of things that are believed to come from a supernatural power or deity , such as God , the supreme being, creator deity , or spirits , and are therefore regarded as sacred and holy .
Such things are regarded as divine due to their transcendental origins or because their attributes or qualities are superior or supreme relative to things of the Earth .
Divine things are regarded as eternal and based in truth , while material things are regarded as ephemeral and based in illusion .
Such things that may qualify as divine are apparitions , visions , prophecies , miracles , and in some views also the soul , or more general things like resurrection , immortality , grace , and salvation .
Otherwise what is or is not divine may be loosely defined, as it is used by different belief systems .
The root of the word divine is literally godly (from the Latin deus , cf.
Dyaus , closely related to Greek zeus , div in Persian and deva in Sanskrit ), but the use varies significantly depending on which deity is being discussed.
This article outlines the major distinctions in the conventional use of the terms.
For specific related academic terms, see Divinity (academic discipline) , or Divine (Anglican) .
Solitude is a state of seclusion or isolation, i.e., lack of contact with people.
It may stem from bad relationships, loss of loved ones, deliberate choice, infectious disease , mental disorders , neurological disorders or circumstances of employment or situation (see castaway ).
Short-term solitude is often valued as a time when one may work, think or rest without being disturbed.
It may be desired for the sake of privacy .
A distinction has been made between solitude and loneliness .
In this sense, these two words refer, respectively, to the joy and the pain of being alone.
Liquor (also hard liquor , hard alcohol , spirit , or distilled drink ) is an alcoholic drink produced by distillation of grains, fruit, or vegetables that have already gone through alcoholic fermentation .
The distillation process purifies the liquid and removes diluting components like water, for the purpose of increasing its proportion of alcohol content (commonly expressed as alcohol by volume, ABV ).
As liquors contain significantly more alcohol , they are considered harder – in North America, the term hard liquor is used to distinguish distilled alcoholic drinks from non-distilled ones.
As examples, this term does not include beverages such as beer , wine , mead , sake , or cider , as they are fermented but not distilled.
These all have a relatively low alcohol content, typically less than 15%.
Brandy is a liquor produced by the distillation of wine, and has an ABV of over 35%.
Other examples of liquors include vodka , baijiu , gin , rum , tequila , mezcal , and whisky .
(Also see list of alcoholic drinks , and liquors by national origin .)
Symmetry (from Greek συμμετρία symmetria agreement in dimensions, due proportion, arrangement) in everyday language refers to a sense of harmonious and beautiful proportion and balance.
In mathematics, symmetry has a more precise definition, that an object is invariant to any of various transformations; including reflection , rotation or scaling .
Although these two meanings of symmetry can sometimes be told apart, they are related, so in this article they are discussed together.
Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of time ; as a spatial relationship ; through geometric transformations ; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of abstract objects , theoretic models , language , music and even knowledge itself.
This article describes symmetry from three perspectives: in mathematics , including geometry , the most familiar type of symmetry for many people; in science and nature ; and in the arts, covering architecture , art and music .
The opposite of symmetry is asymmetry .
Capital may refer to:
Caracaras are birds of prey in the family Falconidae .
They are traditionally placed in subfamily Polyborinae with the forest falcons , but are sometimes considered to constitute their own subfamily, Caracarinae , or classified as members of the true falcon subfamily, Falconinae .
Caracaras are principally birds of South and Central America , just reaching the southern United States .
Unlike the Falco falcons in the same family, the birds in the five relevant genera are not fast-flying aerial hunters, but are comparatively slow and are often scavengers (a notable exception being the red-throated caracara ).
A lawyer or attorney is a person who practices law , as an advocate , attorney , attorney at law , barrister , barrister-at-law , bar-at-law , canonist , canon lawyer, civil law notary , counsel , counselor, counsellor, solicitor , legal executive , or public servant preparing, interpreting and applying law, but not as a paralegal or charter executive secretary .
Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services.
The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.
Streets are the plural of street, a type of road.
Streets or The Streets may also refer to:
A bull is an intact (i.e., not castrated ) adult male of the species Bos taurus ( cattle ).
More muscular and aggressive than the female of the species, the cow , the bull has long been an important symbol in many cultures, and plays a significant role in both beef ranching and dairy farming , and in a variety of other cultural activities.
Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of horticulture .
In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers , foliage , or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables , leaf vegetables , fruits , and herbs , are grown for consumption, for use as dyes , or for medicinal or cosmetic use.
Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.
Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types of shrubs , trees , and herbaceous plants , to residential back gardens including lawns and foundation plantings, and to container gardens grown inside or outside.
Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a large number of different plants in mixed plantings.
It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry .
A miner is a person who extracts ore , coal , or other mineral from the earth through mining .
There are two senses in which the term is used.
In its narrowest sense, a miner is someone who works at the rock face ; cutting, blasting, or otherwise working and removing the rock.
In a broader sense, a miner is anyone working within a mine, not just a worker at the rock face.
Mining is one of the most dangerous trades in the world.
In some countries, miners lack social guarantees and in case of injury may be left to cope without assistance.
In regions with a long mining tradition, many communities have developed cultural traditions and aspects specific to the various regions, in the forms of particular equipment, symbolism, music, and the like.
A bomb is an explosive weapon that uses the exothermic reaction of an explosive material to provide an extremely sudden and violent release of energy .
Detonations inflict damage principally through ground- and atmosphere-transmitted mechanical stress , the impact and penetration of pressure-driven projectiles, pressure damage, and explosion-generated effects.
Bombs have been utilized since the 11th century starting in East Asia .
The term bomb is not usually applied to explosive devices used for civilian purposes such as construction or mining , although the people using the devices may sometimes refer to them as a bomb.
The military use of the term bomb, or more specifically aerial bomb action, typically refers to airdropped, unpowered explosive weapons most commonly used by air forces and naval aviation .
Other military explosive weapons not classified as bombs include shells , depth charges (used in water), or land mines .
In unconventional warfare , other names can refer to a range of offensive weaponry.
For instance, in recent Middle Eastern conflicts, homemade bombs called improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have been employed by insurgent fighters to great effectiveness.
The word comes from the Latin bombus , which in turn comes from the Greek βόμβος ( bombos ), an onomatopoetic term meaning booming, buzzing.
Osteoporosis is a disease in which bone weakening increases the risk of a broken bone .
It is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly .
Bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine , the bones of the forearm , and the hip .
Until a broken bone occurs there are typically no symptoms.
Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously.
Chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities may occur following a broken bone.
Osteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal maximum bone mass and greater-than-normal bone loss.
Bone loss increases after menopause due to lower levels of estrogen .
Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments, including alcoholism , anorexia , hyperthyroidism , kidney disease , and surgical removal of the ovaries .
Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss, including some antiseizure medications , chemotherapy , proton pump inhibitors , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , and glucocorticosteroids .
Smoking and too little exercise are also risk factors.
Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density of 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young adult.
This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry .
Prevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood and efforts to avoid medications that increase the rate of bone loss.
Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet, exercise, and fall prevention .
Lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking and not drinking alcohol may help.
Biphosphonate medications are useful in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis.
In those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones, they are less effective.
A number of other medications may also be useful.
Osteoporosis becomes more common with age.
About 15% of Caucasians in their 50s and 70% of those over 80 are affected.
It is more common in women than men.
In the developed world , depending on the method of diagnosis, 2% to 8% of males and 9% to 38% of females are affected.
Rates of disease in the developing world are unclear.
About 22 million women and 5.5 million men in the European Union had osteoporosis in 2010.
In the United States in 2010, about eight million women and one to two million men had osteoporosis.
White and Asian people are at greater risk.
The word osteoporosis is from the Greek terms for porous bones.
In general, a rural area or countryside is a geographic area that is located outside towns and cities .
The Health Resources and Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines the word rural as encompassing ...all population, housing, and territory not included within an urban area .
Whatever is not urban is considered rural.
Typical rural areas have a low population density and small settlements.
Agricultural areas are commonly rural, as are other types of areas such as forest .
Different countries have varying definitions of rural for statistical and administrative purposes.
Trade involves the transfer of goods or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money .
A system or network that allows trade is called a market .
The first trade occurred when the farmer traded goods with the shepherd .
An early form of trade, barter , saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services.
Barter involves trading things without the use of money.
Later, one bartering party started to involve precious metals , which gained symbolic as well as practical importance.
Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money.
As a result, buying can be separated from selling , or earning .
The invention of money (and later credit , paper money and non-physical money ) greatly simplified and promoted trade.
Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade , while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade .
In one modern view, trade exists due to specialization and the division of labor , a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production, but use their output in trades for other products and needs.
Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage (perceived or real) in the production of some trade-able commodity —including production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere, or because different regions' sizes may encourage mass production .
In such circumstances, trade at market prices between locations can benefit both locations.
Retail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location (such as a department store , boutique or kiosk ), online or by mail , in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the purchaser.
Wholesale trade is defined as traffic in goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers , or to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services.

Rang may refer to:
A jungle is land covered with dense vegetation dominated by trees.
Application of the term has varied greatly during the past recent centuries.
Before the 1970s, tropical rainforests were generally referred to as jungles but this terminology has fallen out of usage.
Jungles in Western literature can represent a less civilised or unruly space outside the control of civilisation, attributed to the jungle's association in colonial discourse with places colonised by Europeans.

Argentina ( Spanish: aɾxenˈtina ), officially the Argentine Republic (Spanish: República Argentina ), is a country located mostly in the southern half of South America .
Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south.
With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km (1,073,500 sq mi), Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the fourth largest in the Americas , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation.
The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad autónoma ), Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation (Spanish: Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress .
The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system .
Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands (Spanish: Islas Malvinas ), and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands .
The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period.
The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times.
The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century.
Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776.
The declaration and fight for independence (1810–1818) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861, culminating in the country's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city.
The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability, with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry, and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .
The almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity led to Argentina becoming the seventh wealthiest nation in the world by the early 20th century.
Following the Great Depression in the 1930s, Argentina descended into political instability and economic decline that pushed it back into underdevelopment, though it remained among the fifteen richest countries for several decades.
Following the death of President Juan Perón in 1974, his widow, Isabel Martínez de Perón , ascended to the presidency.
She was overthrown in 1976 by a U.S.-backed coup which installed a right-wing military dictatorship .
The military government persecuted and murdered numerous political critics, activists, and leftists in the Dirty War , a period of state terrorism that lasted until the election of Raúl Alfonsín as President in 1983.
Several of the junta's leaders were later convicted of their crimes and sentenced to imprisonment.
Argentina is a prominent regional power in the Southern Cone and Latin America, and retains its historic status as a middle power in international affairs.
Argentina has the second largest economy in South America , the third-largest in Latin America, and membership in the G-15 and G-20 major economies.
It is also a founding member of the United Nations , World Bank , World Trade Organization , Mercosur , Union of South American Nations , Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of Ibero-American States .
Despite its history of economic instability, it ranks second highest in the Human Development Index in Latin America and it is classified as a World Bank middle income economy by the World Bank.
Dance is a performing art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement .
This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture .
Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography , by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin .
An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance, although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social , ceremonial , competitive , erotic , martial , or sacred / liturgical .
Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts , gymnastics , cheerleading , figure skating , synchronized swimming , marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.
Professor (commonly abbreviated as Prof.
) is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries.
Literally, professor derives from Latin as a person who professes being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank.
In most systems of academic ranks the word Professor only refers to the most senior academic position, sometimes informally known as full professor.
In some countries or institutions, the word professor is also used in titles of lower ranks such as associate professor and assistant professor ; this is particularly the case in the United States, where the word professor is sometimes used colloquially to refer to anyone in an academic post.
This colloquial usage would be considered incorrect among most other academic communities.
However, the unqualified title Professor designated with a capital letter usually refers to a full professor also in English language usage.
Professors often conduct original research and commonly teach undergraduate , professional and postgraduate courses in their fields of expertise.
In universities with graduate schools , professors may mentor and supervise graduate students conducting research for a thesis or dissertation .
In many universities, 'full professors' take on senior managerial roles, leading departments, research teams and institutes, and filling roles such as president , principal or vice-chancellor .
The role of professor may be more public facing than that of more junior staff, and professors are expected to be national or international leaders in their field of expertise.
Stephen or Steven is a common English first name .
It is particularly significant to Christians , as it belonged to Saint Stephen (Greek Στέφανος Stéphanos ), an early disciple and deacon who, according to the Book of Acts , was stoned to death; he is widely regarded as the first martyr (or protomartyr ) of the Christian Church .
The name Stephen (and its common variant Steven) is derived from Greek Στέφανος ( Stéphanos ), a first name from the Greek word στέφανος ( stéphanos ), meaning wreath, crown and by extension reward, honor, renown, fame, from the verb στέφειν ( stéphein ), to encircle, to wreathe.
In Ancient Greece , crowning wreaths (such as laurel wreaths ) were given to the winners of contests.
Originally, as the verb suggests, the noun had a more general meaning of any circle—including a circle of people, a circling wall around a city, and, in its earliest recorded use, the circle of a fight, which is found in the Iliad of Homer .
The name, in both the forms Stephen and Steven, is commonly shortened to Steve or Stevie .
In English, the female version of the name is Stephanie .
Many surnames are derived from the first name, including Stephens , Stevens , Stephenson , and Stevenson , all of which mean Stephen's (son).
In modern times especially the name has sometimes been given with intentionally nonstandard spelling, such as Stevan or Stevon .
A common variant of the name used in English is Stephan ; related names that have found some currency or significance in English include Stefan (pronounced or in English), Esteban (often pronounced ), and the Shakespearean Stephano .
Like all biblical names, Stephen has forms in almost all major world languages.
Some of these include: Esteban ( Spanish ; Spanish pronunciation: esˈteβan ); Estêvão ( Portuguese ); Esteve ( Catalan ); Estève ( Occitan ); Étienne ( French ); Istifanus ( Arabic ); István ( Hungarian ); Setefane ( Sotho ); Shtjefni ( Albanian ); Sītífán ( Mandarin Chinese ); Stefan ( German , Dutch , Norwegian , Swedish , Danish , Ukrainian , Bulgarian , and Serbian ; German pronunciation: ˈʃteːfan ); Stefán ( Icelandic ); Степан/Stepan ( Russian , Ukrainian ); Ștefan ( Romanian ); Štefan ( Slovak and Slovenian ); Stefana ( Malagasy ); Stefano ( Italian and Swahili ); Stefanos (modern Greek , modern Hebrew , and Estonian ); Stefans ( Latvian and Afrikaans ); Steffan ( Welsh ); Stepan ( Armenian ); Štěpán ( Czech ); Stepane ( Georgian ); Steponas ( Lithuanian ); Stiofán ( Irish ); Sutepano ( Japanese ); Szczepan ( Polish ); and Tapani ( Finnish ).
In the United Kingdom, it peaked during the 1950s and 1960s as one of the top ten male first names (ranking third in 1954) but had fallen to twentieth by 1984 and had fallen out of the top one hundred by 2002.
The name was ranked 201 in the United States in 2009, according to the Social Security Administration.
The name reached its peak popularity in 1951 but remained very common through the mid-1990s, when popularity started to decrease in the United States.

Korea is a region in East Asia .
Since 1948 it has been divided between two distinct sovereign states , North Korea and South Korea .
Korea consists of the Korean Peninsula , Jeju Island , and several minor islands near the peninsula.
Korea is bordered by Russia to the northeast, China to the northwest, and neighbours Japan to the east via the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea).
During the first half of the 1st millennium , Korea was divided between the three competing states of Goguryeo , Baekje , and Silla , together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea .
In the second half of the 1st millennium, Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo, leading to the Unified Silla period.
Meanwhile, Balhae formed in the north, superseding former Goguryeo.
Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war , ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms .
Toward the end of the 1st millennium, Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo , which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state.
Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo.
Goryeo (also spelled as Koryŏ ), whose name developed into the modern exonym Korea, was a highly cultured state that created the world's first metal movable type in 1234.
However, multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation, which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting.
Following military resistance under King Gongmin which ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo, severe political strife followed, and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye , who established Joseon in July 17, 1392.
The first 200 years of the Joseon era were marked by relative peace.
During this period, the Korean alphabet was created by Sejong the Great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of Confucianism .
During the later part of the dynasty, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the Western nickname of the Hermit Kingdom .
By the late 19th century, the country became the object of imperial design by the Empire of Japan.
After the First Sino-Japanese War , despite the Korean Empire 's effort to modernize, the country was annexed by Japan in 1910 and ruled by it until the end of World War II in August 1945.
In 1945, the Soviet Union and the United States agreed on the surrender of Japanese forces in Korea in the aftermath of World War II, leaving Korea partitioned along the 38th parallel.
The North was under Soviet occupation and the South under U.S. occupation .
These circumstances soon became the basis for the division of Korea by the two superpowers , exacerbated by their inability to agree on the terms of Korean independence.
The Communist-inspired government in the North received backing from the Soviet Union in opposition to the pro-Western government in the South, leading to Korea's division into two political entities: North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea), and South Korea (officially the Republic of Korea).
Tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950.
With involvement by foreign troops, the war ended in a stalemate in 1953, but without a formalized peace treaty.
This status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula.
Both governments of the two Koreas claim to be the sole legitimate government of the region.
A gun is a ranged weapon typically designed to pneumatically discharge projectiles that are solid (most guns) but can also be liquid (as in water guns / cannons and projected water disruptors ) or even charged particles (as in a plasma gun ) and may be free-flying (as with bullets and artillery shells) or tethered (as with Taser guns , spearguns and harpoon guns ).
The means of projectile propulsion vary according to designs, but are traditionally effected by a high gas pressure contained within a shooting tube ( gun barrel ), produced either through the rapid combustion of propellants (as with firearms ), or by mechanical compression (as with air guns ).
The high-pressure gas is introduced behind the projectile, accelerating it down the length of the tube, imparting sufficient launch velocity to sustain its further travel towards the target once the propelling gas ceases acting upon it at the end of the tube.
Alternatively, acceleration via electromagnetic field generation may be employed, in which case the shooting tube may be substituted by guide rails (as in railguns ) or wrapped with magnetic coils (as in coilguns ).
The first devices identified as guns appeared in China from around CE 1000.
By the 12th century, the technology was spreading through the rest of Asia, and into Europe by the 13th century.
Clothing (also known as clothes , apparel and attire ) is a collective term for items worn on the body.
Clothing is typically made of fabrics or textiles but over time has included garments made from animal skin or other thin sheets of materials put together.
The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies .
The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social, and geographic considerations.
Clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements , rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, insect bites , splinters , thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment.
Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body.
Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation .
Wearing clothes is also a social norm , and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing .
Not wearing clothes in public so that genitals , breasts (for women) or buttocks are visible could be considered indecent exposure .
Sacrifice is the offering of food, objects or the lives of animals or humans to a higher purpose, in particular divine beings, as an act of propitiation or worship .
While sacrifice often implies the ritual killing of an animal , the term offering (Latin oblatio ) can be used for bloodless sacrifices of food or artifacts.
For offerings of liquids (beverages) by pouring, the term libation is used.
Scholars such as René Girard have theorized that scapegoating may account for the origins of sacrifice.
Architecture (Latin architectura , from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton architect, from ἀρχι- chief and τέκτων creator) is both the process and the product of planning , designing , and constructing buildings or any other structures .
Architectural works, in the material form of buildings , are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art .
Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.
A demon is a supernatural and often malevolent being prevalent historically in religion , occultism , literature , fiction , mythology , and folklore ; as well as in media such as comics , videogames , movies and television series .
The original Greek word daimon does not carry negative connotations.
The Ancient Greek word δαίμων daimōn denotes a spirit or divine power, much like the Latin genius or numen .
The Greek conception of a daimōn notably appears in the works of Plato , where it describes the divine inspiration of Socrates .
In Ancient Near Eastern religions and in the Abrahamic traditions , including ancient and medieval Christian demonology , a demon is considered a harmful spiritual entity which may cause demonic possession , calling for an exorcism .
In Western occultism and Renaissance magic , which grew out of an amalgamation of Greco-Roman magic , Jewish Aggadah and Christian demonology , a demon is believed to be a spiritual entity that may be conjured and controlled.
Slate is a fine-grained, foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale -type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism .
It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock.
Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering, but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression.
The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage .
It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression.
When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation, with a specialized tool in the quarry, many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles, and other purposes.
Slate is frequently grey in color, especially when seen, en masse, covering roofs.
However, slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality; for example, slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey, from pale to dark, and may also be purple, green or cyan .
Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed, or schist .
The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock.
It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate, or a writing slate .
They were traditionally a small, smooth piece of the rock, often framed in wood, used with chalk as a notepad or noticeboard, and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns.
The phrases clean slate and blank slate come from this usage.
Latin (Latin: lingua latīna , IPA: ˈlɪŋɡʷa laˈtiːna ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages .
The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet .
Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome , known as Latium .
Through the power of the Roman Republic , it became the dominant language in Italy, and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire .
Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages , such as French , Italian , Portuguese , Romanian , and Spanish .
Latin has contributed many words to the English language .
In particular, Latin (and Ancient Greek ) roots are used in English descriptions of theology , the sciences , medicine , and law .
By the late Roman Republic (75 BC), Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin .
Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius .
Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and Medieval Latin was used from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin .
Later, Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved.
Latin was used as the language of international communication, scholarship and science until well into the 18th century, when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars .
Ecclesiastical Latin remains the official language of the Holy See and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church .
Latin is a highly inflected language , with three distinct genders , up to seven noun cases , five declensions, four verb conjugations , three tenses , three persons , three moods , two voices , two or three aspects and two numbers .

July is the seventh month of the year (between June and August ) in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars and the fourth of seven months to have a length of 31 days.
It was named by the Roman Senate in honour of Roman general Julius Caesar , it being the month of his birth.
Prior to that, it was called Quintilis , being the fifth month of the 10-month calendar.
It is on average the warmest month in most of the Northern hemisphere , where it is the second month of summer, and the coldest month in much of the Southern hemisphere , where it is the second month of winter.
The second half of the year commences in July.
In the Southern hemisphere, July is the seasonal equivalent of January in the Northern hemisphere.
Dog days are considered to begin in early July in the Northern Hemisphere , when the hot sultry weather of summer usually starts.
Spring lambs born in late winter or early spring are usually sold before 1 July.
July is the traditional period known as fence month, the closed season for deer in England.
The end of England's High Court of Justice Trinity Term takes place on 31 July.
July is also the time in which the elections take place for the Japanese House of Councillors , held every three years and replacing half of its seats.
In Ancient Rome , the festival of Poplifugia was celebrated on 5 July, and Ludi Apollinares was held on 13 July and for several days afterwards.
However, these dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar .

A lawn is an area of soil-covered land planted with grasses and other durable plants such as clover which are maintained at a short height with a lawnmower (or sometimes grazing animals) and used for aesthetic and recreational purposes.
Lawns are usually composed only of grass species, subject to weed and pest control , maintained in a green color (e.g., by watering ), and are regularly mowed to ensure an acceptable length.
Lawns are used around houses, apartments, commercial buildings and offices.
Many city parks also have large lawn areas.
In recreational contexts, the specialised names turf , pitch , field or green may be used, depending on the sport and the continent.
The term lawn, referring to a managed grass space, dates to no earlier than the 16th century.
Tied to suburban expansion and the creation of the household aesthetic, the lawn is an important aspect of the interaction between the natural environment and the constructed urban and suburban space.
In many suburban areas, there are bylaws in place requiring houses to have lawns and requiring the proper maintenance of these lawns.
In some jurisdictions where there are water shortages, local government authorities are encouraging alternatives to lawns to reduce water use.
The kimono ( 着物 , きもの) is a traditional Japanese garment.
The word kimono literally means ki ( 着 , wearing, specifically on the upper body ) + mono ( 物 , thing ) .
Over time, the kimono has come to be a T-shaped wrapped garment with set sleeve lengths, variations and a set way of construction.
The plural of kimono is kimono , as Japanese does not distinguish plural nouns, though the English plural kimonos is also used.
Kimono are often worn for important public holidays and festivals , and for formal occasions such as weddings and funerals.
The kimono is usually worn ankle-length, though women's kimono are longer as their kimono are folded at the hip .
The collar is attached flatly, and always worn left over right (unless the person wearing the kimono is deceased).
The kimono's sleeves reach the wrist, and variations of kimono may have sleeves long enough to touch the ground.
Kimono are tied with a sash called an obi , knotted at the back, though it is a series of ties called koshihimo ('waist cord/wrap') that actually keep kimono closed, as modern obi are too stiff to keep kimono in place.
The obi is tied in a knot known as a musubi at the back, and there are many varieties of musubi based on formality, obi type and age.
Kimono are generally worn with traditional footwear such as zōri or geta , and split-toed socks called tabi .
Today, kimono are most often worn by women, particularly on special occasions.
Unmarried women traditionally wore furisode ('swinging sleeve') kimono, with almost floor-length sleeves, on special occasions, though even their casual kimono would have longer sleeves with rounded edges at the front.
In modern times, a woman generally only wears furisode to special occasions, and stops wearing furisode in her early 20s, married or not.
Men wear the kimono most often at weddings , tea ceremonies , and other very special or very formal occasions.
The people who tend to wear kimono the most on a daily basis are older men and women, geisha, and sumo wrestlers, the last being required to wear traditional Japanese dress whenever appearing in public.
Italians ( Italian : Italiani itaˈljaːni ) are a Romance ethnic group and nation native to the Italian peninsula and its neighbouring insular territories.
Most Italians share a common culture , history , ancestry or language .
Legally, all Italian nationals are citizens of the Italian Republic , regardless of ancestry or nation of residence (in effect, however, Italian nationality is largely based on jus sanguinis ) and may be distinguished from people of Italian descent without Italian citizenship and from ethnic Italians living in territories adjacent to the Italian Peninsula without Italian citizenship.
The majority of Italian nationals are speakers of Italian (the country official language), or a regional variety thereof .
However, many of them also speak another regional or minority language native to Italy; although there is disagreement on the total number, according to UNESCO there are approximately 30 languages native to Italy (often misleadingly referred to as Italian dialects ).
In 2017, in addition to about 55 million Italians in Italy (91% of the Italian national population), Italian-speaking autonomous groups are found in neighbouring nations: almost a quarter million are in Switzerland , a large population is in France , the entire population of San Marino , and there are smaller groups in Slovenia and Croatia , primarily in Istria ( Istrian Italians ) and Dalmatia ( Dalmatian Italians ).
Because of the wide-ranging diaspora , about 5 million Italian citizens and nearly 80 million people of full or partial Italian ancestry live outside their own homeland, which include the 62.5% of Argentina's population ( Italian Argentines ), 1/3 of Uruguayans ( Italian Uruguayans ), 40% of Paraguayans ( Italian Paraguayans ), 15% of Brazilians ( Italian Brazilians , the largest Italian community outside Italy), and people in other parts of Europe bordering Italy, the Americas (such as Italian Americans , Italian Canadians and Italo-Venezuelans among others), Australasia ( Italian Australians and Italian New Zealanders ), and the Middle East .
Italians have greatly influenced and contributed to diverse fields, notably the arts and music, science and technology, fashion, cuisine, sports, jurisprudence, banking and business both abroad and worldwide.
Furthermore, Italian people are generally known for their localism, both regionalist and municipalist.
Hyenas or hyaenas (from Greek ὕαινα hýaina ) are any feliform carnivoran mammals of the family Hyaenidae .
With only four extant species (in three genera), it is the fifth-smallest biological family in the Carnivora, and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia .
Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems.
Although phylogenetically they are closer to felines and viverrids , and belong to the feliform category, hyenas are behaviourally and morphologically similar to canines in several elements of convergent evolution ; both hyenas and canines are non- arboreal , cursorial hunters that catch prey with their teeth rather than claws.
Both eat food quickly and may store it, and their calloused feet with large, blunt, nonretractable claws are adapted for running and making sharp turns.
However, the hyenas' grooming, scent marking, defecating habits, mating and parental behaviour are consistent with the behaviour of other feliforms.
Spotted hyenas may kill as many as 95% of the animals they eat, while striped hyenas are largely scavengers .
Generally, hyenas are known to drive off larger predators, like lions, from their kills, despite having a reputation in popular culture for being cowardly.
Hyenas are primarily nocturnal animals, but sometimes venture from their lairs in the early-morning hours.
With the exception of the highly social spotted hyena, hyenas are generally not gregarious animals, though they may live in family groups and congregate at kills.
Hyenas first arose in Eurasia during the Miocene period from viverrid-like ancestors, and diversified into two distinct types: lightly built dog-like hyenas and robust bone-crushing hyenas.
Although the dog-like hyenas thrived 15 million years ago (with one taxon having colonised North America), they became extinct after a change in climate along with the arrival of canids into Eurasia.
Of the dog-like hyena lineage, only the insectivorous aardwolf survived, while the bone-crushing hyenas (including the extant spotted, brown and striped hyenas) became the undisputed top scavengers of Eurasia and Africa.
Hyenas feature prominently in the folklore and mythology of human cultures that live alongside them.
Hyenas are commonly viewed as frightening and worthy of contempt.
In some cultures, hyenas are thought to influence peoples spirits, rob graves, and steal livestock and children.
Other cultures associate them with witchcraft, using their body parts in traditional African medicine .
Peopletoys (also known as Devil Times Five and The Horrible House on the Hill , as well as Tantrums in the United Kingdom ) is a 1974 American horror film directed by Sean MacGregor and an uncredited David Sheldon.
The movie stars Sorrell Booke , Gene Evans , Shelley Morrison , and Leif Garrett , along with Leif's real-life sister Dawn Lyn and their real-life mother Carolyn Stellar.
The film follows a group of sociopathic, homicidal children who survive a car accident in the mountains; the murderous fivesome seek refuge in a rural chalet inhabited by several vacationing adults.

Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon , and sometimes other elements.
Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, it is a major component used in buildings , infrastructure , tools , ships , automobiles , machines , appliances , and weapons .
Iron is the base metal of steel.
Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic , depending on its temperature.
In the body-centered cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the center and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell; in the face-centered cubic, there is one atom at the center of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices.
It is the interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties.
In pure iron, the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another, and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easily formed.
In steel, small amounts of carbon, other elements, and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations .
The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight.
Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements, as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel (either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases), slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile, and thus controls and enhances its qualities.
These qualities include the hardness , quenching behavior , need for annealing , tempering behavior , yield strength , and tensile strength of the resulting steel.
The increase in steel's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron's ductility.
Steel was produced in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use began only after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the introduction of the blast furnace and production of crucible steel .
This was followed by the open-hearth furnace and then the Bessemer process in England in the mid-19th century.
With the invention of the Bessemer process, a new era of mass-produced steel began.
Mild steel replaced wrought iron .
Further refinements in the process, such as basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS), largely replaced earlier methods by further lowering the cost of production and increasing the quality of the final product.
Today, steel is one of the most common manmade materials in the world, with more than 1.6 billion tons produced annually.
Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted standards organizations .

Hope is an optimistic state of mind that is based on an expectation of positive outcomes with respect to events and circumstances in one's life or the world at large.
As a verb, its definitions include: expect with confidence and to cherish a desire with anticipation.
Among its opposites are dejection, hopelessness , and despair .

A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebrate skeleton .
Bones protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells , store minerals , provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility .
Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure.
They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple functions .
Bone tissue (osseous tissue) is a hard tissue , a type of dense connective tissue .
It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity.
Bone tissue is made up of different types of bone cells .
Osteoblasts and osteocytes are involved in the formation and mineralization of bone; osteoclasts are involved in the resorption of bone tissue.
Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface.
The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly collagen called ossein and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts.
Bone tissue is a mineralized tissue of two types, cortical bone and cancellous bone .
Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow , endosteum , periosteum , nerves , blood vessels and cartilage .
In the human body at birth, there are over 300 bones, but many of these fuse together during development, leaving a total of 206 separate bones in the adult, not counting numerous small sesamoid bones .
The largest bone in the body is the femur or thigh-bone, and the smallest is the stapes in the middle ear .
The Greek word for bone is ὀστέον (osteon), hence the many terms that use it as a prefix – such as osteopathy .
Gaga (meaning senile, insane or infatuated), ga-ga and variants in other languages may refer to:
A tattoo is a form of body modification where a design is made by inserting ink, dyes and pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to change the pigment .
The art of making tattoos is tattooing .
Tattoos fall into three broad categories: purely decorative (with no specific meaning); symbolic (with a specific meaning pertinent to the wearer); pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item).
In addition, tattoos can be used for identification such as ear tattoos on livestock as a form of branding .
A textile is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibers ( yarn or thread ).
Yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool , flax , cotton , hemp , or other materials to produce long strands.
Textiles are formed by weaving , knitting , crocheting , knotting or tatting , felting , or braiding .
The related words fabric and cloth and material are often used in textile assembly trades (such as tailoring and dressmaking ) as synonyms for textile .
However, there are subtle differences in these terms in specialized usage.
A textile is any material made of interlacing fibres, including carpeting and geotextiles .
A fabric is a material made through weaving, knitting, spreading, crocheting, or bonding that may be used in production of further goods (garments, etc.).
Cloth may be used synonymously with fabric but is often a piece of fabric that has been processed.
A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment.
The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital , which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness.
A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with a large number of beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care.
Specialized hospitals include trauma centers , rehabilitation hospitals , children's hospitals , seniors' ( geriatric ) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital ) and certain disease categories.
Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.
Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received.
A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to medical students and nurses.
The medical facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic .
Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g. surgery and urgent care ) and specialist units such as cardiology .
Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units.
Common support units include a pharmacy , pathology , and radiology .
Hospitals are usually funded by the public sector , health organisations ( for profit or nonprofit ), health insurance companies, or charities , including direct charitable donations.
Historically, hospitals were often founded and funded by religious orders , or by charitable individuals and leaders.
Currently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians , surgeons , nurses , and allied health practitioners , whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by volunteers .
However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the Bon Secours Sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals.
In accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were originally places of hospitality, and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the Royal Hospital Chelsea , established in 1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.
Cavalry (from the French cavalerie , cf.
cheval 'horse') or horsemen are soldiers or warriors who fight mounted on horseback .
Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the combat arms .
An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as cavalryman , horseman , dragoon , or trooper .
The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any military forces that used other animals , such as camels , mules or elephants .
Infantry who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as dragoons , a class of mounted infantry which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title.
Cavalry had the advantage of improved mobility, and a man fighting from horseback also had the advantages of greater height, speed, and inertial mass over an opponent on foot.
Another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent.
The speed, mobility and shock value of the cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the Ancient and Middle Ages ; some forces were mostly cavalry, particularly in nomadic societies of Asia , notably the Mongol armies .
In Europe cavalry became increasingly armoured (heavy) , and eventually became known for the mounted knights .
During the 17th century cavalry in Europe lost most of its armor, ineffective against the muskets and cannon which were coming into use, and by the mid-19th century armor had mainly fallen into disuse, although some regiments retained a small thickened cuirass that offered protection against lances and sabres and some protection against shot.
In the period between the World Wars , many cavalry units were converted into motorized infantry and mechanized infantry units, or reformed as tank troops.
However, some cavalry still served during World War II , notably in the Red Army , the Mongolian People's Army , the Royal Italian Army , the Romanian Army , the Polish Land Forces , and light reconnaissance units within the Waffen SS .
Most cavalry units that are horse-mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles, or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas.
Modern usage of the term generally refers to units performing the role of reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA).
Terrain or relief (also topographical relief ) involves the vertical and horizontal dimensions of land surface.
The term bathymetry is used to describe underwater relief, while hypsometry studies terrain relative to sea level .
The Latin word terra (the root of terrain ) means earth.
In physical geography , terrain is the lay of the land.
This is usually expressed in terms of the elevation , slope , and orientation of terrain features.
Terrain affects surface water flow and distribution.
Over a large area, it can affect weather and climate patterns.
Human development is the process of growth to maturity.
The process begins with fertilization , where an egg released from the ovary of a female is penetrated by a sperm cell from a male.
The resulting zygote develops through mitosis and cell differentiation , and the resulting embryo then implants in the uterus , where the embryo continues development through a fetal stage until birth .
Further growth and development continues after birth, and includes both physical and psychological development, influenced by genetic, hormonal, environmental and other factors.
This continues throughout life: through childhood and adolescence into adulthood .

Passion (Greek πασχω to suffer, to be acted on and Late Latin (chiefly Christian ) passio passion; suffering (from Latin pati to suffer)) is a feeling of intense enthusiasm towards or compelling desire for someone or something.
Passion can range from eager interest in or admiration for an idea, proposal, or cause; to enthusiastic enjoyment of an interest or activity; to strong attraction, excitement, or emotion towards a person.
It is particularly used in the context of romance or sexual desire, though it generally implies a deeper or more encompassing emotion than that implied by the term lust .
Denis Diderot describes passions as penchants, inclinations, desires and aversions carried to a certain degree of intensity, combined with an indistinct sensation of pleasure or pain, occasioned or accompanied by some irregular movement of the blood and animal spirits, are what we call passions.
They can be so strong as to inhibit all practice of personal freedom, a state in which the soul is in some sense rendered passive; whence the name passions.
This inclination or so-called disposition of the soul, is born of the opinion we hold that a great good or a great evil is contained in an object which in and of itself arouses passion.
He further breaks down pleasure and pain, which are the guiding principles of passion into four major categories:
There the factors that lead to the management of passion which are (i) our attitude (ii) our appetite (iii) our aims.

A scholarship is an award of financial aid for a student to further their education .
Scholarships are awarded based upon various criteria, which usually reflect the values and purposes of the donor or founder of the award.
Scholarship money is not required to be repaid.
This article primarily addresses scholarships in North America.
A congress is a formal meeting of the representatives of different countries , constituent states , organizations, trade unions , political parties or other groups.
The term, originally denoting a parley during battle in the Late Middle Ages , is derived from the Latin congressus .
( The dictionary definition of congressus at Wiktionary)
In the mid-1770s, the term was chosen by the 13 British colonies for the Continental Congress to emphasize the status of each colony represented there as a self-governing entity .
Subsequent to the use of congress as the name for the legislature of the U.S. federal government (beginning in 1789), the term has been adopted by many nations to refer to their national legislatures .
Anthrax is an infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis .
It can occur in four forms: skin, lungs, intestinal, and injection.
Symptoms begin between one day and two months after the infection is contracted.
The skin form presents with a small blister with surrounding swelling that often turns into a painless ulcer with a black center.
The inhalation form presents with fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath .
The intestinal form presents with diarrhea which may contain blood, abdominal pains, and nausea and vomiting.
The injection form presents with fever and an abscess at the site of drug injection .
Anthrax is spread by contact with the bacterium's spores , which often appear in infectious animal products.
Contact is by breathing, eating, or through an area of broken skin.
It does not typically spread directly between people.
Risk factors include people who work with animals or animal products, travelers, postal workers, and military personnel.
Diagnosis can be confirmed based on finding antibodies or the toxin in the blood or by culture of a sample from the infected site.
Anthrax vaccination is recommended for people who are at high risk of infection.
Immunizing animals against anthrax is recommended in areas where previous infections have occurred.
Two months of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin , levofloxacin , and doxycycline after exposure can also prevent infection.
If infection occurs treatment is with antibiotics and possibly antitoxin .
The type and number of antibiotics used depends on the type of infection.
Antitoxin is recommended for those with widespread infection.
Although a rare disease, human anthrax, when it does occur, is most common in Africa and central and southern Asia.
It also occurs more regularly in Southern Europe than elsewhere on the continent, and is uncommon in Northern Europe and North America.
Globally, at least 2,000 cases occur a year with about two cases a year in the United States.
Skin infections represent more than 95% of cases.
Without treatment, the risk of death from skin anthrax is 24%.
For intestinal infection, the risk of death is 25 to 75%, while respiratory anthrax has a mortality of 50 to 80%, even with treatment.
Until the 20th century, anthrax infections killed hundreds of thousands of people and animals each year.
Anthrax has been developed as a weapon by a number of countries.
In plant-eating animals, infection occurs when they eat or breathe in the spores while grazing.
Carnivores may become infected by eating infected animals.
Produce is a generalized term for many farm -produced crops , including fruits and vegetables ( grains , oats , etc.
are also sometimes considered produce ).
More specifically, the term produce often implies that the products are fresh and generally in the same state as where and when they were harvested .
In supermarkets , the term is also used to refer to the section of the store where fruit and vegetables are kept.
Produce is the main product sold by greengrocers (UK, Australia) and farmers' markets .
The term is widely and commonly used in the U.S., but is not typically used outside the agricultural sector in other English-speaking countries .
In parts of the world, including the U.S., produce is marked with small stickers bearing price look-up codes .
These four- or five- digit codes are a standardized system intended to aid checkout and inventory control at places where produce is sold.
A savanna or savannah is a mixed woodland grassland ecosystem characterised by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close.
The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of grasses.
Savannas maintain an open canopy despite a high tree density.
It is often believed that savannas feature widely spaced, scattered trees.
However, in many savannas, tree densities are higher and trees are more regularly spaced than in forests.
The South American savanna types cerrado sensu stricto and cerrado dense typically have densities of trees similar to or higher than that found in South American tropical forests, with savanna ranging from 800–3300 trees per hectare (trees/ha) and adjacent forests with 800–2000 trees/ha.
Similarly Guinean savanna has 129 trees/ha, compared to 103 for riparian forest , while Eastern Australian sclerophyll forests have average tree densities of approximately 100 per hectare, comparable to savannas in the same region.
Savannas are also characterised by seasonal water availability, with the majority of rainfall confined to one season; they are associated with several types of biomes , and are frequently in a transitional zone between forest and desert or grassland .
Savanna covers approximately 20% of the Earth's land area.

A candle is an ignitable wick embedded in wax , or another flammable solid substance such as tallow , that provides light , and in some cases, a fragrance .
A candle can also provide heat , or be used as a method of keeping time .
The candle can be used during the event of a power outage to provide light .
A person who makes candles is traditionally known as a chandler .
Various devices have been invented to hold candles, from simple tabletop candlesticks, also known as candle holders, to elaborate chandeliers .
For a candle to burn, a heat source (commonly a naked flame) is used to light the candle's wick, which melts and vaporizes a small amount of fuel (the wax).
Once vaporized, the fuel combines with oxygen in the atmosphere to ignite and form a constant flame .
This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events: the heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via capillary action ; the liquefied fuel finally vaporizes to burn within the candle's flame.
As the fuel (wax) is melted and burned, the candle becomes shorter.
Portions of the wick that are not emitting vaporized fuel are consumed in the flame.
The incineration of the wick limits the exposed length of the wick, thus maintaining a constant burning temperature and rate of fuel consumption.
Some wicks require regular trimming with scissors (or a specialized wick trimmer ), usually to about one-quarter inch (~0.7 cm), to promote slower, steady burning, and also to prevent smoking.
Special candle-scissors called snuffers were produced for this purpose in the 20th century and were often combined with an extinguisher.
In modern candles, the wick is constructed so that it curves over as it burns.
This ensures that the end of the wick gets oxygen and is then consumed by fire —a self-trimming wick.
Infrastructure is the fundamental facilities and systems serving a country, city, or other area, including the services and facilities necessary for its economy to function.
Infrastructure is composed of public and private physical improvements such as roads , railways , bridges , tunnels , water supply , sewers , electrical grids , and telecommunications (including Internet connectivity and broadband speeds ).
In general, it has also been defined as the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions .
There are two general types of ways to view infrastructure, hard or soft.
Hard infrastructure refers to the physical networks necessary for the functioning of a modern industry .
This includes roads, bridges, railways , etc.
Soft infrastructure refers to all the institutions that maintain the economic , health , social , and cultural standards of a country.
This includes educational programs , official statistics , parks and recreational facilities, law enforcement agencies, and emergency services .
The word infrastructure has been used in French since 1875 and in English since 1887, originally meaning The installations that form the basis for any operation or system.
The word was imported from French , where it was already used for establishing a roadbed of substrate material, required before railroad tracks or constructed pavement could be laid on top of it.
The word is a combination of the Latin prefix infra, meaning below and many of these constructions are underground, for example, tunnels, water and gas systems, and railways and the French word structure (derived from the Latin word structura).
The army use of the term achieved currency in the United States after the formation of NATO in the 1940s, and by 1970 was adopted by urban planners in its modern civilian sense.

Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge .
In early days, electricity was considered as being unrelated to magnetism .
Later on, many experimental results and the development of Maxwell's equations indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon: electromagnetism .
Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning , static electricity , electric heating , electric discharges and many others.
The presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, produces an electric field .
The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field .
When a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it.
The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law .
Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge.
Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts .
Electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies, being used for:
Electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use.
The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution .
Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport , heating , lighting , communications , and computation .
Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.
A fee is the price one pays as remuneration for rights or services.
Fees usually allow for overhead , wages , costs , and markup .
Traditionally, professionals in the United Kingdom (and previously the Republic of Ireland) receive a fee in contradistinction to a payment, salary, or wage, and often use guineas rather than pounds as units of account .
Under the feudal system , a Knight's fee was what was given to a knight for his service, usually the usage of land.
A contingent fee is an attorney's fee which is reduced or not charged at all if the court case is lost by the attorney.
A service fee, service charge , or surcharge is a fee added to a customer's bill.
The purpose of a service charge often depends on the nature of the product and corresponding service provided.
Examples of why this fee is charged are: travel time expenses, truck rental fees, liability and workers' compensation insurance fees, and planning fees.
UPS and FedEx have recently begun surcharges for fuel.
Restaurants and banquet halls charging service charges in lieu of tips must distribute them to their wait staff in some US states (e.g., Massachusetts , New York, Montana ), but in the state of Kentucky may keep them.
A fee may be a flat fee or a variable one, or part of a two-part tariff .
A membership fee is charged as part of a subscription business model .

A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas.
Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public.
Writers' texts are published across a range of media.
Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.
The term writer is also used elsewhere in the arts – such as songwriter – but as a standalone writer normally refers to the creation of written language.
Some writers work from an oral tradition .
Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional.
Other writers use multiple media – for example, graphics or illustration – to enhance the communication of their ideas.
Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific nature.
Some writers may use images (drawing, painting, graphics) or multimedia to augment their writing.
In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.
As well as producing their own written works, writers often write on how they write (that is, the process they use); why they write (that is, their motivation); and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism).
Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance (or on acceptance), or only after their work is published.
Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are never paid for their work.
The term writer is often used as a synonym of author , although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative.
Writers choose from a range of literary genres to express their ideas.
Most writing can be adapted for use in another medium.
For example, a writer's work may be read privately or recited or performed in a play or film.
Satire for example, may be written as a poem, an essay, a film, a comic play, or a piece of journalism.
The writer of a letter may include elements of criticism, biography, or journalism.
Many writers work across genres.
The genre sets the parameters but all kinds of creative adaptation have been attempted: novel to film; poem to play; history to musical.
Writers may begin their career in one genre and change to another.
For example, historian William Dalrymple began in the genre of travel literature and also writes as a journalist.
Many writers have produced both fiction and non-fiction works and others write in a genre that crosses the two.
For example, writers of historical romances , such as Georgette Heyer , invent characters and stories set in historical periods.
In this genre, the accuracy of the history and the level of factual detail in the work both tend to be debated.
Some writers write both creative fiction and serious analysis, sometimes using different names to separate their work.
Dorothy Sayers , for example, wrote crime fiction but was also a playwright, essayist, translator, and critic.

Association football , more commonly known as football or soccer , is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams of eleven players .
It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport.
The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end.
The object of the game is to score by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal.
Association football is one of a family of football codes , which emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity.
The modern game traces its origins to 1863 when the Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association .
Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the goalkeepers within the penalty area .
Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms.
The team that scores most goals by the end of the match wins.
If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition.
Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French : Fédération Internationale de Football Association ), which organises World Cups for both men and women every four years.
A vulture is a scavenging bird of prey .
The two types of vultures are the New World vultures , including the Californian and Andean condors , and the Old World vultures , including the birds that are seen scavenging on carcasses of dead animals on African plains .
Some traditional Old World vultures (including the bearded vulture ) are not closely related to the others, which is why the vultures are to be subdivided into three taxa rather than two.
New World vultures are found in North and South America ; Old World vultures are found in Europe , Africa , and Asia , meaning that between the two groups, vultures are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica (though Trigonoceps vultures have crossed the Wallace line ).
A particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald head , devoid of normal feathers .
Although it has been historically believed to help keep the head clean when feeding, the bare skin may play an important role in thermoregulation .
Vultures have been observed to hunch their bodies and tuck in their heads in the cold, and open their wings and stretch their necks in the heat.
Vultures also use urine as a way to keep themselves cool by urinating on themselves.
A group of vultures is called a kettle, committee or wake.
The term kettle refers to vultures in flight, while committee refers to vultures resting on the ground or in trees.
Wake is reserved for a group of vultures that are feeding.
The word Geier (taken from the German language ) does not have a precise meaning in ornithology ; it is occasionally used to refer to a vulture in English, as in some poetry.
A dictatorship is an authoritarian form of government, characterized by a single leader or group of leaders with either no party or a weak party, little mass mobilization, and limited political pluralism.
According to other definitions, democracies are regimes in which those who govern are selected through contested elections; therefore dictatorships are not democracies.
With the advent of the 19th and 20th centuries, dictatorships and constitutional democracies emerged as the world's two major forms of government , gradually eliminating monarchies , one of the traditional widespread forms of government of the time.
Typically, in a dictatorial regime, the leader of the country is identified with the title of dictator , although their formal title may more closely resemble something similar to leader.
A common aspect that characterized dictatorship is taking advantage of their strong personality, usually by suppressing freedom of thought and speech of the masses, in order to maintain complete political and social supremacy and stability.
Dictatorships and totalitarian societies generally employ political propaganda to decrease the influence of proponents of alternative governing systems.
Wool is the textile fiber obtained from sheep and other animals, including cashmere and mohair from goats , qiviut from muskoxen , from hide and fur clothing from bison , angora from rabbits , and other types of wool from camelids ; additionally, the Highland and the Mangalica breeds of cattle and swine , respectively, possess wooly coats.
Wool consists of protein together with a few percent lipids.
In this regard it is chemically quite distinct from the more dominant textile, cotton , which is mainly cellulose.
Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of horticulture .
In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers , foliage , or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables , leaf vegetables , fruits , and herbs , are grown for consumption, for use as dyes , or for medicinal or cosmetic use.
Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.
Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types of shrubs , trees , and herbaceous plants , to residential back gardens including lawns and foundation plantings, and to container gardens grown inside or outside.
Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a large number of different plants in mixed plantings.
It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry .
Freelance (sometimes spelled free-lance or free lance ), freelancer , and freelance worker , are terms commonly used for a person who is self-employed and is not necessarily committed to a particular employer long-term.
Freelance workers are sometimes represented by a company or a temporary agency that resells freelance labor to clients; others work independently or use professional associations or websites to get work.
While the term independent contractor would be used in a higher register of English to designate the tax and employment classes of this type of worker, the term freelancing is most common in culture and creative industries, and use of this term may indicate participation therein.
Fields, professions, and industries where freelancing is predominant include: music , writing , acting , computer programming , web design , graphic design , translating and illustrating , film and video production and other forms of piece work which some cultural theorists consider as central to the cognitive-cultural economy .
Sewage (or domestic wastewater or municipal wastewater ) is a type of wastewater that is produced by a community of people.
It is characterized by volume or rate of flow , physical condition, chemical and toxic constituents, and its bacteriologic status (which organisms it contains and in what quantities).
It consists mostly of greywater (from sinks, tubs, showers, dishwashers, and clothes washers), blackwater (the water used to flush toilets , combined with the human waste that it flushes away); soaps and detergents; and toilet paper (less so in regions where bidets are widely used instead of paper).
Sewage usually travels from a building's plumbing either into a sewer , which will carry it elsewhere, or into an onsite sewage facility (of which there are many kinds).
Whether it is combined with surface runoff in the sewer depends on the sewer design ( sanitary sewer or combined sewer ).
The reality is that most wastewater produced globally remains untreated causing widespread water pollution , especially in low-income countries: A global estimate by UNDP and UN-Habitat is that 90% of all wastewater generated is released into the environment untreated.
In many developing countries the bulk of domestic and industrial wastewater is discharged without any treatment or after primary treatment only.
The term sewage is nowadays regarded as an older term and is being more and more replaced by wastewater.
In general American English usage, the terms sewage and sewerage mean the same thing.
In common British usage, and in American technical and professional English usage, sewerage refers to the infrastructure that conveys sewage.
Schumacher or Schuhmacher is an occupational surname (German, shoemaker , pronounced ˈʃuːmaxɐ , both variants can be used as surnames, with Schumacher being the more popular one, however, only the variant with two hs can also be used as a job description in modern German spelling).
The variant Schumaker is also commonly seen in the USA.
Some notable people with Schumacher surname:
The lion ( Panthera leo ) is one of the largest species in the family Felidae ; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
The lion is sexually dimorphic ; males are larger than females with a typical weight range of 150 to 250 kg (330 to 550 lb) for males and 120 to 182 kg (265 to 400 lb) for females.
Male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species.
Lions are social , forming groups called prides .
A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs.
Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates .
The species is an apex and keystone predator , although they scavenge when opportunities occur.
Some lions have been known to hunt humans, although the species typically does not.
Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas but is absent in dense forests .
It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight .
In the Pleistocene , the lion ranged throughout Eurasia, Africa and North America but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in Sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered population in western India.
It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s.
Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas.
Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature.
Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century.
Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in the Upper Paleolithic period; carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France have been dated to 17,000 years ago, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures that coincided with the lion's former and current ranges.
Bars or bars can refer to:
A hole is an opening in or through a particular medium, usually a solid body.
Holes occur through natural and artificial processes, and may be useful for various purposes, or may represent a problem needing to be addressed in many fields of engineering.
Depending on the material and the placement, a hole may be an indentation in a surface (such as a hole in the ground), or may pass completely through that surface (such as a hole created by a hole puncher in a piece of paper).
In engineering, a hole may be blind or through if it is partial or complete depth.

Syria ( Arabic : سوريا ‎, romanized : Sūriyā ), officially the Syrian Arab Republic ( Arabic : الجمهورية العربية السورية ‎, romanized : al-Jumhūrīyah al-ʻArabīyah as-Sūrīyah ), is a country in Western Asia , bordering Lebanon to the southwest, the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest.
A country of fertile plains, high mountains, and deserts, Syria is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups , including Syrian Arabs , Greeks , Armenians , Assyrians , Kurds , Circassians , Mandeans and Turkemens .
Religious groups include Sunnis , Christians , Alawites , Druze , Isma'ilis , Mandeans , Shiites , Salafis , Yazidis , and Jews .
Sunnis make up the largest religious group in Syria.
Syria is a unitary republic consisting of 14 governorates and is the only country that politically espouses Ba'athism .
It is a member of one international organization other than the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement ; it has become suspended from the Arab League in November 2011 and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , and self-suspended from the Union for the Mediterranean .
In English , the name Syria was formerly synonymous with the Levant (The region of Syria , known in Arabic as al-Sham ), while the modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires, including the Eblan civilization of the 3rd millennium BC .
Aleppo and the capital city Damascus are among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world .
In the Islamic era, Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt .
The modern Syrian state was established in the mid-20th century after centuries of Ottoman and a brief period French mandate , and represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman -ruled Syrian provinces .
It gained de jure independence as a parliamentary republic on 24 October 1945, when Republic of Syria became a founding member of the United Nations, an act which legally ended the former French Mandate – although French troops did not leave the country until April 1946.
The post-independence period was tumultuous, and a large number of military coups and coup attempts shook the country in the period 1949–71.
In 1958, Syria entered a brief union with Egypt called the United Arab Republic , which was terminated by the 1961 Syrian coup d'état .
The republic was renamed into the Arab Republic of Syria in late 1961 after December 1 constitutional referendum , and was increasingly unstable until the 1963 Ba'athist coup d'état , since which the Ba'ath Party has maintained its power.
Syria was under Emergency Law from 1963 to 2011, effectively suspending most constitutional protections for citizens.
Bashar al-Assad has been president since 2000 and was preceded by his father Hafez al-Assad , who was in office from 1971 to 2000.
Since March 2011, Syria has been embroiled in an armed conflict , with a number of countries in the region and beyond involved militarily or otherwise.
As a result, a number of self-proclaimed political entities have emerged on Syrian territory, including the Syrian opposition , Rojava , Tahrir al-Sham and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant .
Syria is ranked last on the Global Peace Index , making it the most violent country in the world due to the war.
The war has killed more than 570,000 people, caused 7.6 million internally displaced people (July 2015 UNHCR estimate) and over 5 million refugees (July 2017 registered by UNHCR ), making population assessment difficult in recent years.
Femininity (also called girlishness or womanliness ) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles generally associated with girls and women.
Femininity is socially constructed, but made up of both socially-defined and biologically-created factors.
This makes it distinct from the definition of the biological female sex , as both males and females can exhibit feminine traits.
Traits traditionally cited as feminine include gentleness , empathy , humility , and sensitivity , though traits associated with femininity vary depending on location and context, and are influenced by a variety of social and cultural factors.
A motorcycle , often called a bike , motorbike , or cycle , is a two- or three-wheeled motor vehicle .
Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long distance travel, commuting , cruising , sport including racing , and off-road riding.
Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies .
In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a motorcycle.
In 2014, the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were Honda , Yamaha (both from Japan), and Hero MotoCorp (India).
In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy .
Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.
According to the US Department of Transportation the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.

Masculinity (also called manhood or manliness ) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles associated with boys and men.
As a social construct, it is distinct from the definition of the male biological sex .
Standards of manliness or masculinity vary across different cultures and historical periods.
Both males and females can exhibit masculine traits and behavior.
Traits traditionally viewed as masculine in Western society include strength , courage , independence , leadership , and assertiveness .
Machismo is a form of masculinity that emphasizes power and is often associated with a disregard for consequences and responsibility.
Virility (from the Latin vir , man) is similar to masculinity, but especially emphasizes strength, energy, and sex drive .

A tyrant (from Ancient Greek τύραννος , túrannos ), in the modern English-language usage of the word, is an absolute ruler unrestrained by law, or one who has usurped legitimate sovereignty.
Often portrayed as cruel, tyrants may defend their position by oppressive means.
The original Greek term, however, merely meant an authoritarian sovereign without reference to character, bearing no pejorative connotation during the Archaic and early Classical periods.
However, Plato , the Greek philosopher, clearly saw tyrannos as a negative word, and on account of the decisive influence of philosophy on politics, its negative connotations only increased, continuing into the Hellenistic period .
The philosophers Plato and Aristotle defined a tyrant as a person who rules without law, using extreme and cruel methods against both their own people and others.
The Encyclopédie defined the term as a usurper of sovereign power who makes his subjects the victims of his passions and unjust desires, which he substitutes for laws.
In the late fifth and fourth centuries BC, a new kind of tyrant, one who had the support of the military , arose – specifically in Sicily .
One can apply accusations of tyranny to a variety of types of government:
The definition of tyranny can extend to other oppressive forms of policies.
A stairway , staircase , stairwell , flight of stairs , or simply stairs, is a construction designed to bridge a large vertical distance by dividing it into smaller vertical distances, called steps .
Stairs may be straight, round, or may consist of two or more straight pieces connected at angles.
Special types of stairs include escalators and ladders .
Some alternatives to stairs are elevators (lifts in British English), stairlifts and inclined moving walkways as well as stationary inclined sidewalks (pavements in British English).

Brown is a composite color .
In the CMYK color model used in printing or painting, brown is made by combining red , black , and yellow , or red, yellow, and blue .
In the RGB color model used to project colors onto television screens and computer monitors, brown is made by combining red and green , in specific proportions.
In painting, brown is generally made by adding black to orange.
Mixing red-green-blue pigments makes mud color.
The brown color is seen widely in nature, in wood, soil, human hair color, eye color and skin pigmentation .
Brown is the color of dark wood or rich soil.
According to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, brown is the least favorite color of the public; the color is most often associated with plainness, the rustic and poverty .
A son is a male offspring ; a boy or man in relation to his parents .

The iPod is a line of portable media players and multi-purpose pocket computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc.
The first version was released on October 23, 2001, about ​ 8 ⁄ 2 months after the Macintosh version of iTunes was released.
As of May 28, 2019, only the iPod Touch (7th generation) remains in production.
Like other digital music players, iPods can serve as external data storage devices .
Apple's iTunes software (and other alternative software) can be used to transfer music, photos, videos, games , contact information, e-mail settings, Web bookmarks, and calendars, to the devices supporting these features from computers using certain versions of Apple macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems.
Before the release of iOS 5, the iPod branding was used for the media player included with the iPhone and iPad , a combination of the Music and Videos apps on the iPod Touch.
As of iOS 5, separate apps named Music and Videos are standardized across all iOS-powered products.
While the iPhone and iPad have essentially the same media player capabilities as the iPod line, they are generally treated as separate products.
During the middle of 2010, iPhone sales overtook those of the iPod.
Awareness is the ability to directly know and perceive , to feel, or to be cognizant of events.
More broadly, it is the state of being conscious of something.
Another definition describes it as a state wherein a subject is aware of some information when that information is directly available to bring to bear in the direction of a wide range of behavioral processes .
The concept is often synonymous to consciousness and is also understood as being consciousness itself.
The states of awareness are also associated with the states of experience so that the structure represented in awareness is mirrored in the structure of experience.
A birthday is the anniversary of the birth of a person, or figuratively of an institution .
Birthdays of people are celebrated in numerous cultures, often with birthday gifts , birthday cards , a birthday party , or a rite of passage .
Many religions celebrate the birth of their founders or religious figures with special holidays (e.g. Christmas , Mawlid , Buddha's Birthday , and Krishna Janmashtami ).
There is a distinction between birth day and birth date : The former, other than February 29 , occurs each year (e.g. January 15), while the latter is the exact date a person was born (e.g., January 15, 2001).
A symbol is a mark, sign or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea , object , or relationship .
Symbols allow people to go beyond what is known or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences.
All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols.
Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs.
For example, a red octagon may be a symbol for STOP.
On a map, a blue line might represent a river.
Numerals are symbols for numbers .
Alphabetic letters may be symbols for sounds.
Personal names are symbols representing individuals.
A red rose may symbolize love and compassion.
The variable 'x', in a mathematical equation, may symbolize the position of a particle in space.
In cartography , an organized collection of symbols forms a legend for a map.

Tibet ( ( listen ) ; Tibetan : བོད་ , Lhasa dialect : /pʰøː˨˧˩/ ; Chinese : 西藏 ; pinyin : Xīzàng ) is a region covering much of the Tibetan Plateau in modern-day China .
It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa , Tamang , Qiang , Sherpa , and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people .
Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of 5,000 m (16,000 ft).
The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest , Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level.
The Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century, but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories .
The bulk of western and central Tibet ( Ü-Tsang ) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa , Shigatse , or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship.
Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing, with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders.
The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo ; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai .
The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century.
Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet Area (Ü-Tsang).
The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent Chinese Republican government .
Later, Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang , China.
The region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when, following the Battle of Chamdo , Tibet became incorporated into the People's Republic of China , and the previous Tibetan government was abolished in 1959 after a failed uprising.
Today, China governs western and central Tibet as the Tibet Autonomous Region while the eastern areas are now mostly ethnic autonomous prefectures within Sichuan , Qinghai and other neighbouring provinces.
There are tensions regarding Tibet's political status and dissident groups that are active in exile.
Tibetan activists in Tibet have reportedly been arrested or tortured.
The economy of Tibet is dominated by subsistence agriculture , though tourism has become a growing industry in recent decades.
The dominant religion in Tibet is Tibetan Buddhism ; in addition there is Bön , which is similar to Tibetan Buddhism, and there are also Tibetan Muslims and Christian minorities.
Tibetan Buddhism is a primary influence on the art , music , and festivals of the region.
Tibetan architecture reflects Chinese and Indian influences.
Staple foods in Tibet are roasted barley , yak meat, and butter tea .
A tomb (from Greek : τύμβος tumbos ) is a repository for the remains of the dead.
It is generally any structurally enclosed interment space or burial chamber, of varying sizes.
Placing a corpse into a tomb can be called immurement , and is a method of final disposition , as an alternative to for example cremation or burial .

Volunteering is generally considered an altruistic activity where an individual or group provides services for no financial or social gain to benefit another person, group or organization.
Volunteering is also renowned for skill development and is often intended to promote goodness or to improve human quality of life .
Volunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served.
It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment.
Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine , education , or emergency rescue .
Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster .
In a military context a volunteer is someone who joins an armed force of their own volition rather than being conscripted , and is usually paid.
Perspiration , also known as sweating , is the production of fluids secreted by the sweat glands in the skin of mammals .
Two types of sweat glands can be found in humans: eccrine glands and apocrine glands .
The eccrine sweat glands are distributed over much of the body.
In humans , sweating is primarily a means of thermoregulation , which is achieved by the water-rich secretion of the eccrine glands.
Maximum sweat rates of an adult can be up to 2–4 liters per hour or 10–14 liters per day (10–15 g/minm ), but is less in children prior to puberty.
Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface has a cooling effect due to evaporative cooling .
Hence, in hot weather, or when the individual's muscles heat up due to exertion, more sweat is produced.
Animals with few sweat glands, such as dogs , accomplish similar temperature regulation results by panting, which evaporates water from the moist lining of the oral cavity and pharynx .
Although sweating is found in a wide variety of mammals, relatively few (exceptions include humans and horses) produce large amounts of sweat in order to cool down.
Orléans ( UK : , US : , French: ɔʁleɑ̃ ( listen ) ) is a prefecture and commune in north-central France, about 111 kilometres (69 miles) southwest of Paris .

Pesticides are substances that are meant to control pests , including weeds.
The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide , insecticides (which may include insect growth regulators , termiticides, etc.) nematicide , molluscicide , piscicide , avicide , rodenticide , bactericide , insect repellent , animal repellent , antimicrobial , and fungicide .
The most common of these are herbicides which account for approximately 80% of all pesticide use.
Most pesticides are intended to serve as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general, protect plants from weeds , fungi, or insects .
In general, a pesticide is a chemical or biological agent (such as a virus , bacterium , or fungus ) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests.
Target pests can include insects, plant pathogens , weeds, molluscs , birds , mammals , fish , nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease vectors .
Along with these benefits, pesticides also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other species.
Hiking is the preferred term, in Canada and the United States, for a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails ( footpaths ), in the countryside, while the word walking is used for shorter, particularly urban walks.
On the other hand, in the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland, the word walking is acceptable to describe all forms of walking, whether it is a walk in the park or backpacking in the Alps .
The word hiking is also often used in the UK, along with rambling (a slightly old-fashioned term), hillwalking , and fell walking (a term mostly used for hillwalking in northern England).
The term bushwalking is endemic to Australia, having been adopted by the Sydney Bush Walkers club in 1927.
In New Zealand a long, vigorous walk or hike is called tramping .
It is a popular activity with numerous hiking organizations worldwide, and studies suggest that all forms of walking have health benefits.

Shafts was an English feminist periodical produced by Margaret Sibthorp from 1892 until 1899.
Initially published weekly and priced at one penny , its themes included votes for women, women's education, and radical attitudes towards vivisection, dress reform, women's control of their sexuality, child care, and vegetarianism.
Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions , such as governments , sovereign states , federated states , and other subnational entities .
Borders are established through agreements between political or social entities that control those areas; the creation of these agreements is called boundary delimitation .
Some borders—such as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Area —are often open and completely unguarded.
Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled.
Borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones .
A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier , the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.

Nilotic -speaking pastoralists (ancestral to Kenya's Nilotic speakers) started migrating from present-day Southern Sudan into Kenya around 500 BC.
European colonisation of Kenya began in the 19th century during the European exploration of the interior .
The modern-day Kenya emerged from a protectorate established by the British Empire in 1895 and the subsequent Kenya Colony , which began in 1920.
Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colony led to the Mau Mau revolution , which began in 1952, and the subsequent declaration of independence in 1963.
After independence, Kenya remained a member of the Commonwealth of Nations .
The current constitution was adopted in 2010 to replace the 1963 independence constitution .

Gospel originally meant the Christian message itself, but in the 2nd century it came to be used for the books in which the message was set out.
The four canonical gospels — Matthew , Mark , Luke and John —were probably written between AD 66 and 110, building on older sources and traditions, and each gospel has its own distinctive understanding of Jesus and his divine role.
All four are anonymous (the modern names were added in the 2nd century), and it is almost certain that none were written by an eyewitness.
They are the main source of information on the life of Jesus as searched for in the quest for the historical Jesus .
Modern scholars are cautious of relying on them unquestioningly, but critical study attempts to distinguish the original ideas of Jesus from those of the later authors.
Many non-canonical gospels were also written, all later than the four, and all, like them, advocating the particular theological views of their authors.

Starbucks was founded in Seattle , Washington in 1971.
As of early 2019, the company operates over 30,000 locations worldwide.
Starbucks is considered the main representative of second wave coffee, initially distinguishing itself from other coffee-serving venues in the US by taste, quality, and customer experience while popularizing darkly roasted coffee.
Since the 2000s, third wave coffee makers have targeted quality-minded coffee drinkers with hand-made coffee based on lighter roasts, while Starbucks nowadays uses automated espresso machines for efficiency and safety reasons.
Starbucks locations serve hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, microground instant coffee known as VIA, espresso , caffe latte , full- and loose-leaf teas including Teavana tea products, Evolution Fresh juices, Frappuccino beverages, La Boulange pastries , and snacks including items such as chips and crackers; some offerings (including their annual fall launch of the Pumpkin Spice Latte ) are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store.
Many stores sell pre-packaged food items, hot and cold sandwiches, and drinkware including mugs and tumblers ; select Starbucks Evenings locations offer beer , wine , and appetizers.
Starbucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are also sold at grocery stores .
Starbucks first became profitable in Seattle in the early 1980s.
Despite an initial economic downturn with its expansion into the Midwest and British Columbia in the late 1980s, the company experienced revitalized prosperity with its entry into California in the early 1990s.
The first Starbucks location outside North America opened in Tokyo in 1996; overseas properties now constitute almost one-third of its stores.
The company opened an average of two new locations daily between 1987 and 2007.
On December 1, 2016, Howard Schultz announced he would resign as CEO effective April 2017 and would be replaced by Kevin Johnson .

Soil is a mixture of organic matter , minerals , gases , liquids , and organisms that together support life .
Earth 's body of soil, called the pedosphere , has four important functions :
All of these functions, in their turn, modify the soil.
The pedosphere interfaces with the lithosphere , the hydrosphere , the atmosphere , and the biosphere .
The term pedolith , used commonly to refer to the soil, translates to ground stone in the sense fundamental stone.
Soil consists of a solid phase of minerals and organic matter (the soil matrix), as well as a porous phase that holds gases (the soil atmosphere) and water (the soil solution).
Accordingly, soil scientists can envisage soils as a three- state system of solids, liquids, and gases.
Soil is a product of several factors: the influence of climate , relief (elevation, orientation, and slope of terrain), organisms, and the soil's parent materials (original minerals) interacting over time.
It continually undergoes development by way of numerous physical, chemical and biological processes, which include weathering with associated erosion .
Given its complexity and strong internal connectedness , soil ecologists regard soil as an ecosystem .
Most soils have a dry bulk density (density of soil taking into account voids when dry) between 1.1 and 1.6 g/cm , while the soil particle density is much higher, in the range of 2.6 to 2.7 g/cm .
Little of the soil of planet Earth is older than the Pleistocene and none is older than the Cenozoic , although fossilized soils are preserved from as far back as the Archean .
Soil science has two basic branches of study: edaphology and pedology .
Edaphology studies the influence of soils on living things.
Pedology focuses on the formation, description (morphology), and classification of soils in their natural environment.
In engineering terms, soil is included in the broader concept of regolith , which also includes other loose material that lies above the bedrock, as can be found on the Moon and on other celestial objects as well.
Soil is also commonly referred to as earth or dirt ; some scientific definitions distinguish dirt from soil by restricting the former term specifically to displaced soil.
A shovel is a tool for digging, lifting, and moving bulk materials, such as soil , coal , gravel , snow , sand , or ore .
Most shovels are hand tools consisting of a broad blade fixed to a medium-length handle.
Shovel blades are usually made of sheet steel or hard plastics and are very strong.
Shovel handles are usually made of wood (especially specific varieties such as ash or maple ) or glass-reinforced plastic (fibreglass).
Hand shovel blades made of sheet steel usually have a folded seam or hem at the back to make a socket for the handle.
This fold also commonly provides extra rigidity to the blade.
The handles are usually riveted in place.
A T-piece is commonly fitted to the end of the handle to aid grip and control where the shovel is designed for moving soil and heavy materials.
These designs can all be easily mass-produced .
The term shovel also applies to larger excavating machines called power shovels , which serve the same purpose—digging, lifting, and moving material.
Modern power shovels descend from steam shovels .
Loaders and excavators (such as backhoes ) perform similar work, etically speaking, but are not classified as shovels emically .
Hand shovels have been adapted for many different tasks and environments.
They can be optimized for a single task or designed as cross-over or compromise multitaskers .
It's very useful in agriculture.

Ford Motor Company is an American multinational automaker that has its main headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan , a suburb of Detroit .
It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903.
The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand and most luxury cars under the Lincoln brand.
Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer Troller , an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the United Kingdom and a 32% stake in Jiangling Motors .
It also has joint-ventures in China ( Changan Ford ), Taiwan ( Ford Lio Ho ), Thailand ( AutoAlliance Thailand ), Turkey ( Ford Otosan ), and Russia ( Ford Sollers ).
The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family ; they have minority ownership but the majority of the voting power.
Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines ; by 1914, these methods were known around the world as Fordism .
Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover , acquired in 1989 and 2000 respectively, were sold to Tata Motors of India in March 2008.
Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010.
In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938.
Ford is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (behind General Motors ) and the fifth-largest in the world (behind Toyota , VW , Hyundai-Kia and General Motors) based on 2015 vehicle production.
At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth largest automaker in Europe.
The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special Class B shares, still retain 40 percent voting rights.
During the financial crisis at the beginning of the 21st century, it was close to bankruptcy, but it has since returned to profitability.
Ford was the eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the 2018 Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7 billion.
In 2008, Ford produced 5.532 million automobiles and employed about 213,000 employees at around 90 plants and facilities worldwide.
A journalist is a person who collects, writes, or distributes news or other current information to the public.
A journalist's work is called journalism .
A journalist can work with general issues or specialize in certain issues.
However, most journalists tend to specialize, and by cooperating with other journalists, produce journals that span many topics.
For example, a sports journalist covers news within the world of sports, but this journalist may be a part of a newspaper that covers many different topics.

A boat is a watercraft of a large range of type and size.
Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on their larger size, shape, and cargo or passenger capacity, and their ability to carry boats.
Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes , or in protected coastal areas.
However, some boats, such as the whaleboat , were intended for use in an offshore environment.
In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship.
Anomalous definitions exist, as bulk freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes being known as oreboats .
Boats vary in proportion and construction methods due to their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions.
Canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport.
Fishing boats vary widely in style partly to match local conditions.
Pleasure craft used in recreational boating include ski boats, pontoon boats , and sailboats .
House boats may be used for vacationing or long-term residence.
Lighters are used to convey cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore.
Lifeboats have rescue and safety functions.
Boats can be propelled by manpower (e.g. rowboats and paddle boats ), wind (e.g. sailboats ), and motor (including gasoline , diesel , and electric).
Predation is a biological interaction where one organism, the predator , kills and eats another organism, its prey .
It is one of a family of common feeding behaviours that includes parasitism and micropredation (which usually do not kill the host ) and parasitoidism (which always does, eventually).
It is distinct from scavenging on dead prey, though many predators also scavenge; it overlaps with herbivory, as a seed predator is both a predator and a herbivore .
Predators may actively search for prey or sit and wait for it.
When prey is detected, the predator assesses whether to attack it.
This may involve ambush or pursuit predation , sometimes after stalking the prey.
If the attack is successful, the predator kills the prey, removes any inedible parts like the shell or spines, and eats it.
Predators are adapted and often highly specialized for hunting, with acute senses such as vision , hearing , or smell .
Many predatory animals , both vertebrate and invertebrate , have sharp claws or jaws to grip, kill, and cut up their prey.
Other adaptations include stealth and aggressive mimicry that improve hunting efficiency.
Predation has a powerful selective effect on prey, and the prey develop antipredator adaptations such as warning coloration , alarm calls and other signals , camouflage , mimicry of well-defended species, and defensive spines and chemicals.
Sometimes predator and prey find themselves in an evolutionary arms race , a cycle of adaptations and counter-adaptations.
Predation has been a major driver of evolution since at least the Cambrian period.

The metre ( Commonwealth spelling and BIPM spelling ) or meter ( American spelling ) (from the French unit mètre , from the Greek noun μέτρον, measure) is the base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI).
The SI unit symbol is m .
The metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1 / 299 792 458 of a second .
The metre was originally defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole – as a result, the Earth's circumference is approximately 40,000 km today.
In 1799, it was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar (the actual bar used was changed in 1889).
In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86 .
In 1983, the current definition was adopted.
The imperial inch is defined as 0.0254 metres (2.54 centimetres or 25.4 millimetres).
One metre is about ​ 3 ⁄ 8 inches longer than a yard , i.e. about ​ 39 ⁄ 8 inches.
