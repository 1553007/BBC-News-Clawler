US banking group Morgan Stanley says it has had a solid second quarter after pre-tax profits dipped to $2.9bn (£2.3bn) from $3.1bn in the same period a year earlier.
Net revenue was $10.2bn - down from $10.6bn a year earlier - but meant that revenue exceeding $10bn for four out ofthe last six quarters, it said.
James Gorman, chief executive, said, “We reported solid quarterly results across all ourbusinesses.
Firmwide revenues were over $10bn and we produced a return on equity within our target range,demonstrating the stability of our franchise.
Net profit was $2.2bn - ahead of expectations.
Golf has endured a roller coaster decade, with the number of challenges it has faced being matched only by regular bulletins predicting its demise.
The sport has been accused - among other criticisms - of being too white, male, elderly, expensive, time-consuming, and generally out of step in an increasingly inclusive world.
Over the past 12 months, for every fillip provided by a high-profile event such as Tiger Wood's amazing win in the US Masters , it seems there has been bad news about the closure of another golf club.
Faced with a similar situation many businesses would look to expand their appeal, and experts are agreed that the biggest growth potential for golf is enticing more women into the sport.
Over the past few years not only have a number of big clubs - such as the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews , Muirfield , Royal Troon , Royal Aberdeen, and Royal St George's - dropped their men-only membership stance, but there is now also a positive drive to attract females to the sport.
A number of clubs in the UK have tried to change and attract more women, says Alistair Dunsmuir, editor of magazine The Golf Business.
They have introduced women-only golf courses, and coaching sessions, and have looked to attract more female coaching staff.
They have also tried to create a more sociable environment, where women can stay behind for a glass of wine afterwards.
Other clubs have introduced creches, so that mothers can have a relaxing round of golf or meet with friends in the clubhouse.
He adds: Golf is also looking to increase its appeal to children and teenagers - the sport has realised if it wants to have growth it can't rely just on older white men.
Meanwhile, participation programmes such as Girls Golf Rocks and Love.Golf, are looking to encourage women to give the sport a try.
Greenkeepers and architects These initiatives are all positive signs of progress, and indeed at a professional level, there are six women's regional golf tours across the globe, including in the US, Japan.
But in terms of general participation, for example across the UK and Ireland, less than 20% of golfers are women.
In Sweden that figure rises to 29%, but globally only a quarter of active golfers are female.
And off the playing courses and in the boardrooms at senior executive level, as well as in other industry roles, progress is slow.
According to research from grass management firm Syngenta, which has been part of the golf industry for more than 30 years , just a fifth of all members of the Golf Club Managers Association - a primarily UK body, but also with some international members - are female.
Their research shows less than 1% of members of Bigga (British & International Golf Greenkeepers Association), are women.
And currently only two women are members of the European Institute of Golf Course Architects.
'Grass roots' But plugging into a significant latent demand among non-golfing women, could provide as much as an $35bn (£28bn) a year value to the golf industry, Syngenta suggests.
They also said there could be as many as 37 million prospective new female players around the world interested in taking up the game.
Meanwhile, more female club managers, greenkeepers and golf course architects would drive greater profitability in the golf industry, according to a leading expert on diversity and inclusion in business.
Liz Dimmock, founder and boss of Women Ahead, a social impact organisation committed to female development from schoolroom to boardroom, says businesses and sports with more diverse management teams are more profitable.
Yet in the US for example, the world's largest golf market, women make up less than 9% of club general managers, only 1.5% of greenkeepers and there have only ever been a handful of female members of the American Society of Golf Course Architects.
If you are looking to change the landscape of the sport, then there should undoubtedly be more women in golf - whether it be through increased grass roots players or having more females in leadership positions in the sector, she says.
But you need more diverse minds, from a number of different backgrounds, not just based on gender.
You need people from outside the sport sector too.
And it is not just about representative numbers either, their views need to be treasured and included in the decision-making process.
Ms Dimmock, who has worked for IMG, KPMG, and HSBC, adds: If golf can do this then there can be huge rewards around the financial side, with more female participation, and more sponsorship opportunities for golf.
Also when women play or watch sport they often do so as part of a family, bringing more young girls and boys potentially into the sport.
'Inclusive' The R&A is the body that organises The Open, golf's oldest major championship, and whose 148th tournament is takes place at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland this week.
It also recently launched a Women in Golf Charter, as part of its drive to increase the number of women and girls playing golf and working within the golf industry.
The charter aims to inspire an industry-wide commitment to developing a more inclusive culture within golf around the world and to enable more women and girls to flourish and maximise their potential at all levels of the sport.
It will require national federations and other golf bodies to focus on encouraging more women and girls to play golf and stay within the sport as members of clubs, while also empowering women to enjoy successful careers working within the golf industry.
'Important step' The R&A has provided an initial three-year funding package of £375,000 to its affiliates in Australia, England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales to support the appointment of new development managers to work on increasing participation by women and girls.
It has also increased its prize money by 40% for the 2019 AIG Women's British Open taking place at Woburn next month, to $4.5m (£3.6m), in recognition of the importance of the Championship and women's golf.
The Women's British Open now offers the second highest prize fund of the five major championships in the women's game.
R&A boss Martin Slumbers says: This is an important first step and we know it will take time to move closer to achieving parity with the men's game.
There is a beloved story about the dimensions of the space shuttle.
Apparently the booster rockets had to fit through railway tunnels designed to accommodate a horse and cart.
In short, the space shuttle boosters were the width of two horses' backsides.
A similar - and quite true - story can be told about the new poster child of the space industry, the CubeSat.
Its dimensions were determined by the size of a Beanie Baby.
The cuddly toy was all the rage in 1999, when Stanford University professor Bob Twiggs was teaching his graduate students to design satellites.
Back then, satellites were big.
The Artemis telecommunications satellite launched in 2001 and weighed more than three tonnes.
It was 8m tall and each of its two solar panels was as long as a bus.
With that much space and weight to play with, the temptation was to pack more and more gear into the satellite.
However, that would have made it increasingly expensive - not to mention encouraging lazy thinking.
If you've got lots of room to put everything in, you end up not being too careful with it, says Prof Twiggs.
So he and his colleague decided that the students needed a constraint.
Prof Twiggs went to his local store, where he spotted a Beanie Baby toy neatly packed in its box.
He went back to class, placed the box on the desk, and told his students: Your satellite needs to be able to fit in this box.
And this educational challenge evolved into a practical standard for a whole new generation of tiny satellites.

CubeSat is a slight misnomer: the unit actually measures 10cm by 10cm by 11.35cm.
CubeSats can be several units big, but are still about the size of a shoebox, and weigh kilograms rather than tonnes.
One planned CubeSat, the Lunar Flashlight, aims to orbit the moon, reflecting sunlight into deep craters and analysing the light that bounces back.
The Near-Earth Asteroid Scout project will collect data from asteroids and send its findings back to earth.
But for now, most CubeSats are designed to take images of our planet from above.
The basic ingredients: a smartphone processor, solar panels, a camera, and some batteries.
CubeSats are cheap to make and cheap to launch.
Traditionally, the entire process from start to launch of a major satellite might cost $500m (£394m).
You could get a CubeSat into low earth orbit for closer to $100,000.
Big rockets such as the European Space Agency's Ariane 5, or Russia's Soyuz-2, are about 50m tall.
But CubeSats and other tiny satellites can ride on much smaller private sector rockets, like the 18m-tall Electron rocket launched from Rocket Lab's New Zealand base.
CubeSats can also piggyback on a large satellite launch.
Early in 2017, India's official space agency, ISRO, launched 104 satellites in a single launch - a world record.
Three of the satellites were large, but the rest were tiny, including 88 CubeSats owned by a new Silicon Valley company, Planet.
Planet was founded in 2010 and has the world's largest private fleet of satellites - more than 140 of them.
They take more than a million photographs a day - covering anywhere on the globe, once every 24 hours.
They can't match the sophisticated imaging of a large satellite.
However, they do provide better coverage, by taking more photographs of more places within any given time frame.
And Planet's 140 satellites may be the vanguard of something much bigger.
Both SpaceX and Amazon have announced plans to launch thousands of satellites in low-earth orbit.
CubeSats have three lessons to teach us about the modern economy.
The first is why cheap, standardised modular parts are so important.
While we reserve our attention and our plaudits for unique and complex projects, being cheap changes everything.
Second, CubeSat pioneers have embraced the fail-fast model of Silicon Valley.
Nasa, as a public agency, has a very low tolerance for risk.
But an expendable CubeSat allows a different approach: if you're launching dozens at a time, you can lose one or two here and there.
While Nasa has traditionally focused on ensuring that expensive kit works perfectly, the CubeSat model says don't worry.
Failing with disposable satellites is cheaper than succeeding with big ones.
If it doesn't work, try again.
But third, don't dismiss the public sector too casually.
It is easy to define private space exploration in contrast with Nasa and other national space agencies.
In fact Nasa has quietly supported CubeSats - by funding small CubeSat-launching rockets.
It has also given CubeSats free rides to the International Space Station, where they can be launched through a special airlock.
CubeSats may soon be teaching us something entirely new about the way the economy works.
The great economist Alfred Marshall died in 1924.
He called economics the study of humanity in the ordinary business of life.
CubeSats allow us to observe the ordinary business of life as it unfolds, all around the world, day by day, and in some detail.
Economic forecasters have not been slow to notice this possibility.
More Things That Made the Modern Economy: Lots of people would love to know if oil prices will go up or down, whether there is a glut in the wheat market, or a shortage of high-quality coffee.
It does not take much imagination to see how daily images of crops would give you an edge.
With the right analysis, and the right photographs, you may also be able to spot trucks on the road or count oil storage tanks.
Maybe you could even estimate how much electricity a power plant is generating by looking at the plumes of smoke.
But beyond this, satellites promise to show up hidden connections in the workings of the world's economy.
Algorithms are starting to extract subtle information at scale: how many of those houses in a Kenyan village have metal roofs?
Which roads in Cameroon are in good condition - and has foreign aid money made any difference?
There is so much going on under the surface of a big economy.
So much of it does not show up in regular statistical releases for months - sometimes years.
Now we can see it day by day.
As the old story about the space shuttle and the horse's backside reminds us, some things in our economy change slowly.
But a lot of the modern economy moves very quickly indeed.
No wonder some people are keen to take snapshots.

The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.
This week we speak to Hiroki Takeuchi, chief executive of financial technology business GoCardless.
Hiroki Takeuchi had just got married when he was involved in a cycling accident that left him with a life-changing disability.
The then 30-year-old was cycling around London's The Regent's Park back in September 2016 when he collided with a car, crushing his spinal cord.
It left him paralysed from the waist down.
My poor wife, we'd only been married for three weeks, he says.
As Hiroki recovered in hospital, his other concern was for his company GoCardless.
He and two friends had set up the business back in 2011, but Hiroki had been made sole chief executive in 2015.
Fortunately, we had built enough of a team, and a momentum, that they could carry on without me being there day-to-day, says Hiroki.
Even after three months away the business continued to do well, and that was good to see - it's nice to know something you've built has got a life of its own.
Returning to work just 12 weeks after the accident, Hiroki has continued to successfully grow London-based GoCardless.
Its technology enables companies to more easily collect direct debit payments from customers.
It is one of those businesses that most of us have never heard of, but many of us use without knowing it.
More than 40,000 firms around the world now utilise GoCardless' technology to process more than £7.5bn ($9.4bn) of payments per year.
Hiroki, who is half Japanese and half English, grew up in Swindon, in the south of England.
After studying maths at Oxford University he initially joined the London office of management consultancy McKinsey in 2008.
But keen to set up his own company, Hiroki started to explore possible ideas with an old university friend called Tom Blomfield, and McKinsey colleague Matt Robinson.
They decided to look at problems in the world of finance, and identified that electronic payment systems could be improved.
We realised that all these payment systems were a bit broken, says Hiroki.
As the three men continued to work on their idea, in 2011 they landed a spot on a prestigious start-up support programme in Silicon Valley called Y Combinator.
Hundreds of young entrepreneurs around the world apply to join the three-month long scheme each year, but only a small percentage are chosen.
Hiroki says it introduces you to some famous names, and their unvarnished advice.
You would have these weekly dinners where you would get the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, or one of the Airbnb founders, telling you first-hand what their journeys were like.
They were very open - you didn't get the PR version of it.
Deciding to focus the business on helping small firms collect direct debit payments more easily, GoCardless was born, and the three co-founders returned to the UK with an initial $1.5m in funding from Silicon Valley investors.
Hiroki says this was the moment he knew that the business was real.
Investing heavily in staff, with 90% of them being tech hires, Hiroki says they were fortunate when it came to getting their first customers.
One of the big lucky breaks we had early on is that we got introduced to Duane Jackson, who was the CEO and founder of Kashflow, an accounting platform, says Hiroki.
He had 25,000 small businesses doing accounting through this platform, and he was looking for exactly the solution we were providing.
The GoCardless team hadn't even fished their product at the time, so they worked closely with Kashflow to build the first version.
They then got access to all Kashflow's customers.
Like most new businesses, Hiroki says they learned as they went along: You think you know what you're doing, but you basically never do.
It's about how you learn from those mistakes and correct them though.
Everything from marketing in the first place, to how our technology was built - you have to keep reinventing things.
More The Boss features: As GoCardless grew, Tom Blomfield realised it wasn't his passion, so he left in 2013 to launch mobile bank Monzo.
Matt Robinson then departed in 2015, as he and Hiroki realised that the business only needed one leader.
We needed a leader, it could have been Matt or me, but we weren't going to report to each other, says Hiroki.
But with one of us taking that role we knew that one of us would have to step back.
Sankar Krishnan, a banking and capital markets expert at French consultancy group Capgemini, says that GoCardless has been successful in addressing the historic business pain points around managing cash flow.
He adds: It's a practical tool that allows businesses to utilize the advantages of direct debit platforms, wherein one is able to pay and collect with ease from any bank or corporation.
Today GoCardless employs 340 staff globally, with overseas offices in France, Germany, and Australia.
In February of this year it gained a further $75m of investment, including funds from GV, the investment arm of Google's parent company Alphabet.
GoCardless plans to use this additional funding to expand into the US later this year.
It has now raised $123m of investment in total.
While the 33 year old says that the cycling accident obviously changed my life, he has been able to adapt to it in a way that I don't have to give up everything that I had before.
Of course you have to be a bit more organised, especially if you want to go on holiday or do something spontaneous, he adds.
But my injury was low enough that I still have a lot of independence, and I still have full use of my arms and upper body.
Hiroki says that despite the success of the business so far, he is still learning every day.
I always think of myself as the least experienced person in the business.
I've never managed a team this size before, so you're constantly learning.
Dutch airline KLM has caused an uproar on Twitter after telling a customer it might ask mothers to cover themselves while breastfeeding.
KLM told Heather Yimm that breastfeeding on flights is allowed, but if other passengers are offended they may be asked to cover up.
The airline's response has sparked a backlash on Twitter, with many people criticising the policy.
KLM told the BBC it is trying to keep the peace on board its flights.
Of course, breastfeeding is permitted on board KLM flights.
However, not all passengers feel comfortable with breastfeeding in their vicinity, and sometimes these passengers complain to the cabin staff, said a KLM spokeswoman.
The spokeswoman said its aim in such cases was to try to find a solution that is acceptable to everyone and that shows respect for everyone's comfort and personal space.
This may involve a request to a mother to cover her breast, she added.
KLM's response has sparked a flurry of requests from Twitter users asking other airlines, such as British Airways and EasyJet, about their breastfeeding policies.
British Airways told the BBC that it would never look to stop a mother from breastfeeding, and would assist in providing privacy if requested.
We carry thousands of infants and their families on our flights every year, and we welcome breastfeeding on board, said a spokesman.
Meanwhile, EasyJet's official policy says that it supports breastfeeding mothers, and passengers are welcome to feed their babies on board at any time.
Labour and Co-operative Party MP Stella Creasy tweeted that she felt KLM had gone beyond the pale.
On 7 May, customs officers in Ostend, Belgium, received a box of oysters from the UK.
The molluscs had been caught in Essex and transported to Belgium on a 12m (39ft) aluminium-hulled vessel, which traversed the English Channel with no humans on board.
It was the world's first unmanned commercial shipping operation.
The crewless boat was carefully watched by four people in a control centre in Tollesbury, Essex, headquarters of Hushcraft, the company behind the design and development of the craft.
UK and Belgian coastguards also monitored the oysters' progress.
You could actually listen to the waves hitting the boat, says Ben Simpson, Hushcraft's managing director.
It boasts a hybrid diesel engine, electrical generators, satellite links, CCTV and thermal cameras, an automatic identification system to warn approaching vessels of its position and more.
Prize-winning The boat was made by Sea-Kit, and the same vessel helped an international team of hydrographers, funded by the Japanese non-profit Nippon Foundation, win the $4m (£3.2m) Shell Ocean Discovery Xprize for advances in autonomously mapping the oceans.
Now Hushcraft wants Sea-Kit to be used for transporting cargo, hence mounting the 5kg box of oysters - a local delicacy - on to the vessel and sending it to Ostend.
But is there a market for it?
The benefits are many, says Mr Simpson.
You can send them around the world to do different jobs at a significantly reduced cost.
Then, you don't have to have a galley, you don't have to have toilets.
You can utilise space.
They are better for the environment as they can be electrically propelled, and since they can use smaller ports they can replace road transport and cut even more fumes, he says.
Ghost ships For Lawrence Brennan, a retired US navy captain and adjunct professor of admiralty and maritime law at Fordham University School of Law, all these virtues of uncrewed cargo ships come with certain caveats.
Ships with no sailors mean no risk to human life from fires or other hazards at sea.
No-one needs to recruit staff, pay them, keep them trained or guard against unlicensed crew.
The boats can go anywhere.
But, in Prof Brennan's view, the first Achilles heel of unmanned shipping might be the very technology that created it.
A failure in communications between vessel and base will render it a ghost ship, hopelessly drifting without a soul on board, a hazard to its owners, the owners of its cargo, and the environment, he argues.
Get creative Unmanned ships may be stopped by pirates by disabling shots or damaging the ship's propeller and rudder, Prof Brennan continues.
Karolina Zwolak, head of the Navigation Section at the Institute of Navigation and Marine Hydrography of the Polish Naval Academy, contributed to the success of the oysters' voyage.
Part of her job was collision avoidance.
Dr Zwolak is already working on the Sea-Kit international team's next ambitious endeavour, which will be to sail across the Atlantic next year, but is aware of the technology's limitations.
When unexpected situations occur on board, human creativity, experience, and non-schematic thinking can solve the problem, she says.
So she does not see a revolution in the shipping industry in the near future.
I just believe more and more tasks will be delegated on shore, using communication technology, she says.
From crew to office For his part, Mr Simpson, who believes crewless short-sea transportation might not be a rarity in five years from now, says that problems such as the risk of piracy plague both manned and unmanned vessels.
He also thinks it is not economically sound to lay people off.
Unmanned ships need to be built, maintained, and controlled.
The people that would have been on the bridge of a manned vessel are now in the office, he maintains, adding that a lot of training will be involved in the transition.
More Technology of Business The other obstacle is the law.
The legal regime is decades, if not a century-and-a-half out of date, says Prof Brennan.
As unmanned ships were never contemplated until recently, legislation says manning is essential for having a ship that is seaworthy, classified, and authorised to operate in national waters and on the high seas, he explains.
Legal catch-up For self-navigating ships to crisscross the oceans free from legal constraints, an entirely new maritime legislation will have to be drawn up and embedded in national laws and international regimes, otherwise financiers will be frightened off.
Still, the international maritime community is going through such a frenzy of technological creativity, that for Dr Zwolak there will be a solution soon.
Technology has always preceded law, she says.

Public borrowing could double next year if there is a no-deal Brexit, the country's spending watchdog says.
The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said borrowing would be almost £60bn if the UK leaves without a deal - up from £29.3bn if it does get a deal.
The watchdog said this scenario was based on assumptions that a no-deal Brexit would cause a UK recession.
The UK is set to leave the European Union on 31 October.
Chances of a no-deal outcome appear to have risen recently, after both Tory leadership contenders said they would be willing to leave the EU without a deal.
The OBR was created in 2010 to give independent analysis of the UK's public finances.
In its first assessment of the economic impact of a no-deal scenario, the OBR used IMF analysis that shows the UK economy would contract by 2% in 2020 before recovering in 2021.
This would come as tariffs of 4% were imposed on goods traded with the EU - up from zero currently - although the IMF does not expect there to be disruption at the border.
In this scenario, the OBR said that heightened uncertainty and declining confidence would deter investment, while higher trade barriers with the EU would weigh on exports.
Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply, it said.
It said this could push up public sector borrowing, leaving debt 12% higher by 2024.
The OBR added this was not necessarily the most likely outcome but also by no means the worst case scenario.
It also warned that both Conservative leadership contenders had made a series of uncosted proposals for tax cuts and spending increases that would be likely to increase government borrowing by tens of billions of pounds if implemented.
Analysis: By Faisal Islam, BBC economics editor The government's official independent budgetary watchdog has for the first time put a price on the impact to the public finances of leaving the European Union without a deal.
The numbers come at a sensitive time politically when both likely future Prime Ministers suggest that a no-deal Brexit is possible this year.
The OBR is legally obliged to consider all threats to the public finances, and today's new numbers come as part of its biannual Fiscal Risks report.
The fall in tax revenue is forecast to significantly outweigh any benefit from no longer paying the UK's subscription fee as a member of the EU.
The numbers show a deep crisis-like impact on the public finances, and are based on the IMF's projections for the economy.
But they go further, showing a long-run hit to the economy.
The forecast used by the OBR is less severe than those of the Bank of England and the Treasury.
In November, the Bank said a no-deal outcome could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the 2008 financial crisis.
The economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath if there was no transition period, the Bank said.
The Treasury meanwhile has predicted a £90bn hit to the economy by 2035 - although prominent eurosceptics dispute this view.
In a comment piece for the Telegraph newspaper earlier this week, Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg called the forecast silliness, adding that a no-deal scenario could instead boost the economy by £80bn.
On Thursday, Mr Hammond said: The report that the OBR has published shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit, there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy.
But that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiteers.
They are talking about a much harder version that would cause much more disruption.
John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: We know that a no-deal Brexit would devastate the UK economy and the public finances, and it comes on top of the failed economic approach for the last nine years.
This warning makes it even more imperative MPs from across Parliament back today's amendments to try and block the next prime minister from shutting down Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit.
The chances of a no-deal appear to have risen in recent weeks after both candidates in the race to replace Theresa May hardened their positions on the controversial Irish backstop - an insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.
Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson both said the backstop was dead, but the EU said it would not support any deal that excludes it.
In an interview with the BBC's Panorama programme - conducted in May before the start of the Conservative leadership contest - the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the UK would have to face the consequences if it opted to leave without a deal.
Mr Barnier said the thrice-rejected withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May was the only way to leave the EU in an orderly manner.
Shares in Asos have sunk after the online fashion giant said that this year's profits are likely to be much lower than expectations.
The retailer said sales growth in the US and Europe had been held back by problems at its warehouses.
These problems meant that the range of clothes available to shoppers in these markets had been limited.
As a result, it now expects to report profits of £30m-£35m this year, well below the £55m forecast by analysts.
Asos chief executive Nick Beighton said overhauling its US and European warehouses had taken longer than anticipated, affecting its stock availability, sales and cost base in these regions.
He added that the company was clear on what was causing the problems and was making progress on resolving them.
However, Asos said that while the warehouse problems were short-term in nature, it added it might take some time to regain customers who had been affected.
Total sales across the group rose by 12% in the four months to 30 June, Asos said, and in the UK - where trading remained robust - sales grew by 16%.
However, the operational challenges at its warehouses in Berlin and Atlanta had caused problems in the US and Europe, where sales were up 12% and 5% respectively.
'Risk of losing out' Asos has enjoyed rapid growth in recent years as it has benefited from the shift towards shopping online.
However, last December it surprised investors with a shock profit warning, and the company's share price has now more than halved over the past year.
Shares in Asos opened down 20% on Thursday following the latest warning, before recovering some ground to stand 12% lower.
Analysts at Liberum said the latest warning suggested that serious questions needed answering.
The operational issues in Europe and the US signal to us a lack of enough senior leaders in the business with the adequate skill-set in the business to undertake the complex capital projects ongoing, they said.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: Fashion fans have plenty of places from which to buy clothes and so Asos is at risk of losing out to the competition if it cannot fix its problems fast.
We live in an impatient world where so many people want something in an instant.
If Asos doesn't have the stock ready to ship then consumers will simply go elsewhere.
However, Sofie Willmott, an analyst at research firm GlobalData, was more upbeat, arguing that the changes being made to US and EU distribution centres are vital to facilitate long-term growth in these key markets.
She added that the future remains bright for Asos.
The retailer's agility and willingness to change to remain relevant to its customer base will help it to continue gaining market share, both at home and abroad.''
If you were in any doubt that the US-China trade war is having an impact on Asia, look no further than Singapore's latest export figures.
Singapore saw exports fall for a second month in a row, this time by 17.3% in the month of June compared to a year ago.
This dramatic fall comes as Singapore's growth figures released last week showed a 3.4% decline in growth in comparison to the last quarter.
So why should you care if Singapore is selling less of its stuff to the world than it used to?
Canary in the coal mine?
The city state is one of the most trade-dependent economies in the world, and is often seen as a global indicator for trade.
Analysts are calling Singapore's data the canary in the coal mine, a reference to a well-worn expression to indicate there is danger ahead.
The phrase comes from when miners used to carry caged canaries into mine shafts, to let them know if it was dangerous.
The canaries would die if there was even a hint of poisonous gas in the mines, providing a warning signal for the miners to get out.
The worry among Asia-watchers is that Singapore's numbers are just a sign of more bad news to come from the rest of the region.
The trade war effect There is increasing evidence to show that Asia's economies are being hit by the US-China trade war.
Around the region it is a similar story, says Song Seng Wun, South East Asia economist for CIMB Private Bank.
This trade war is coming at a time when global growth is slowing down after ten years of relatively stable times.
Even if by some miracle a fairy taps her magic wand and the trade war disappears, all that would happen is that things would just be less bad - rather than really bad.
Data from India, Indonesia and South Korea reads like a list of bad news.
June was a particularly gloomy month for the three countries.
India saw exports fall by 9.7% , the first time in nine months.
Indonesia, which counts China as its biggest trading partner, also saw exports fall by 8.98% in comparison with the same period last year.
And South Korea also saw exports fall by 13.5% .
All of these countries sell products ranging from palm oil and chemicals to semiconductor chips to China.
This week China posted the lowest quarterly growth it has seen in close to three decades, partly on trade war worries.
US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods now cover more than half of what China sells to the US.
Which means that Chinese companies either have to cut their costs for their buyers, or sell less to the US.
And that means the countries supplying Chinese factories with products are also getting hit.
It doesn't look like it's going to get any better anytime soon.
A report from the Japanese research house Nomura released this week on Asian exports shows that exports should remain in the doldrums in the coming month.
Nomura blames this on the lack of progress on US-China trade negotiations, heightened global uncertainty weighing on corporate investment decisions and signs that trade protectionism is being used as a weapon of foreign policy around the region.
It isn't entirely clear yet when or if the US-China trade war will come to a resolution - or whether this is the start of a broader shift in US policy away from free trade, as think tank Capital Economics points out.
Mr Trump has already indicated that Vietnam - which up to now has been a beneficiary of the US-China trade war - could be next on his tariff list, and economists say Taiwan and South Korea could also be next in line.
Asia is home to the world's next generation of companies and consumers.
By 2050 it could see its share of the global economy grow to 52%, according to the Asian Development Bank - which means the region would also be the main driver of global growth.
But analysts say if the US's anti-free trade trend continues and hits more of Asia's economies, that could hurt the region's long term potential growth rate - in turn hurting the rest of us.
A collection of sneakers has sold at auction for $850,000 (£690,000) to Canadian entrepreneur Miles Nadal.
Sotheby's put 100 pairs of the rarest sneakers ever from Nike, Adidas and Air Jordan on sale in New York.
All but one of the pairs went to Mr Nadal, with the 1972 Nike Waffle Racing Flat Moon Shoe still for sale during the week-long auction.
These are expected to fetch $160,000, confirming, says Sotheby's Noah Wunsch, that sneakers are now collectible art.
The sale also included two pairs of Nike Mags, shoes made famous in the 1989 Back to the Future Part II because they had automatic lacing - a technology the company didn't actually bring to the market until almost three decades later.
The limited edition Back to the Future 2016 sneakers were thought to have fetched between $50,000 and $70,000.
Another star of the auction was the Jeter edition Air Jordan 11, created to commemorate New York Yankee baseball star Derek Jeter's retirement in 2017.
Only five pairs were made.
They were estimated to have sold for close to $60,000.
Mr Nadal told broadcaster CNBC that he plans to display the sneakers at his Dare to Dream Automobile Museum in Toronto, where has a collection of 142 cars and 40 motorcycles.
I have always been an avid enthusiast and appreciator of unique art and collectibles that represent innovative design, exceptional craftsmanship and new and exciting trends in pop culture, he said.
It was unclear if he was bidding for the last remaining pair being auctioned.
The Nike Waffle Moon Shoes were designed by Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman.
Just 12 pairs were made for runners at the 1972 Olympic trials, and the pair being auctioned is thought to be the only ones that weren't actually worn.
Mr Wunsch, Sotheby's global head of e-commerce, said Mr Bowerman literally used a waffle iron to imprint the tread on the shoes.
He said the interest in the auction showed that sneakers were being viewed as works of popular art culture.
I think it's a really fascinating time in the world, where it's it's not so much sneaker culture, it's just culture.
We see luxury all playing in the same field, he said.
The highest price fetched at a public auction for sneakers is thought to be $190,373 for a pair of signed Converse shoes worn by Michael Jordan in the 1984 Olympic basketball final.
The shoes were auctioned in California in 2017.
Water bills in England and Wales are set to fall by an average of £50 between 2020 and 2025, under plans published by the industry regulator.
Ofwat said firms would also have to invest an additional £6m each day in improving services for customers.
It comes amid widespread dissatisfaction with the performance of many water companies.
Ofwat said the measures would mean better services, a healthier natural environment and lower bills.
Water companies will be accountable not just for reporting against their performance but they'll face tough penalties if they don't achieve those targets, Ofwat boss Rachel Fletcher told the BBC's Today programme.
Ofwat said the bill reductions would vary widely - falling by £7 at Hafren Dyfrdwy to £110 at Northumbrian Water compared with 2017-18 prices.
It comes after only three out of 17 water firms in England and Wales passed the last review by Ofwat, published in January.
All firms submitted plans to cut bills over the 2020-25 period, while reducing leaks and helping vulnerable customers.
But only plans from Severn Trent, United Utilities and South West Water were approved.
There have also been continued problems with leaks - particularly after extreme weather events such as last year's Beast from the East icy spell.
While leaks in England and Wales are much lower than they were in the mid-1990s, progress in tackling them has slowed to a crawl since 2001.
Firms will now have to invest more in tackling leaks between 2020 and 2025, saving an amount of water equivalent to the needs of the population of Manchester, Leeds, Leicester and Cardiff.
They will also have to: Reduce supply interruptions by almost two-thirds, Cut pollution incidents Reduce the number of customers with low water pressure Help some 1.5 million customers who are struggling to pay.
Ofwat said this would add up to £12bn of new investment - over and above business-as-usual costs - or £6m per day over the period.
Water companies will be able to make representations about the proposals and the final deals will be confirmed in December.
Tony Smith, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, called the plans good news, but added: Not everyone will see their bills fall when you add inflation and customers need to be told how much Ofwat's financial rewards for companies could hit them in the pocket.
Only about half of the three million households who struggle to afford their water bills will receive financial assistance under these plans, he added.
Public borrowing could double next year if there is a no-deal Brexit, the country's spending watchdog says.
The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said borrowing would be almost £60bn if the UK leaves without a deal - up from £29.3bn if it does get a deal.
The watchdog said this scenario was based on assumptions that a no-deal Brexit would cause a UK recession.
The UK is set to leave the European Union on 31 October.
Chances of a no-deal outcome appear to have risen recently, after both Tory leadership contenders said they would be willing to leave the EU without a deal.
The OBR was created in 2010 to give independent analysis of the UK's public finances.
In its first assessment of the economic impact of a no-deal scenario, the OBR used IMF analysis that shows the UK economy would contract by 2% in 2020 before recovering in 2021.
This would come as tariffs of 4% were imposed on goods traded with the EU - up from zero currently - although the IMF does not expect there to be disruption at the border.
In this scenario, the OBR said that heightened uncertainty and declining confidence would deter investment, while higher trade barriers with the EU would weigh on exports.
Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply, it said.
It said this could push up public sector borrowing, leaving debt 12% higher by 2024.
The OBR added this was not necessarily the most likely outcome but also by no means the worst case scenario.
It also warned that both Conservative leadership contenders had made a series of uncosted proposals for tax cuts and spending increases that would be likely to increase government borrowing by tens of billions of pounds if implemented.
Analysis: By Faisal Islam, BBC economics editor The government's official independent budgetary watchdog has for the first time put a price on the impact to the public finances of leaving the European Union without a deal.
The numbers come at a sensitive time politically when both likely future Prime Ministers suggest that a no-deal Brexit is possible this year.
The OBR is legally obliged to consider all threats to the public finances, and today's new numbers come as part of its biannual Fiscal Risks report.
The fall in tax revenue is forecast to significantly outweigh any benefit from no longer paying the UK's subscription fee as a member of the EU.
The numbers show a deep crisis-like impact on the public finances, and are based on the IMF's projections for the economy.
But they go further, showing a long-run hit to the economy.
The forecast used by the OBR is less severe than those of the Bank of England and the Treasury.
In November, the Bank said a no-deal outcome could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the 2008 financial crisis.
The economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath if there was no transition period, the Bank said.
The Treasury meanwhile has predicted a £90bn hit to the economy by 2035 - although prominent eurosceptics dispute this view.
In a comment piece for the Telegraph newspaper earlier this week, Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg called the forecast silliness, adding that a no-deal scenario could instead boost the economy by £80bn.
On Thursday, Mr Hammond said: The report that the OBR has published shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit, there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy.
But that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiteers.
They are talking about a much harder version that would cause much more disruption.
John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: We know that a no-deal Brexit would devastate the UK economy and the public finances, and it comes on top of the failed economic approach for the last nine years.
This warning makes it even more imperative MPs from across Parliament back today's amendments to try and block the next prime minister from shutting down Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit.
The chances of a no-deal appear to have risen in recent weeks after both candidates in the race to replace Theresa May hardened their positions on the controversial Irish backstop - an insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.
Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson both said the backstop was dead, but the EU said it would not support any deal that excludes it.
In an interview with the BBC's Panorama programme - conducted in May before the start of the Conservative leadership contest - the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the UK would have to face the consequences if it opted to leave without a deal.
Mr Barnier said the thrice-rejected withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May was the only way to leave the EU in an orderly manner.
The number of electric car models available to consumers in Europe is expected to triple by 2021, says a European environmental lobby group.
The uptake of electric cars has been stalling, blamed on a lack of charging infrastructure and higher prices.
Latest data shows carmakers will offer 214 electric car models in 2021, up from 60 models at the end of 2018.
More affordable options could see consumers switch from petrol and diesel cars sooner than anticipated.
Analysis by the European Federation for Transport and Environment (T&E), based on data by research firm IHS Markit, suggests that car manufacturers are now ready to embrace car electrification.
In 2021, carmakers are forecast to bring 92 fully electric models and 118 plug-in hybrid models to market.
If they stick to these plans, 22% of vehicles produced could have a plug by 2025, which would enable manufacturers to easily meet the EU's car CO2 emissions target of 95g/km by 2025.
The biggest electric car production plants will be in Germany, France, Spain and Italy, the data shows.
Some 16 large-scale lithium-ion battery cell plants are confirmed or due to begin operations in Europe by 2023.
Thanks to the EU car CO2 standards, Europe is about to see a wave of new, longer range, and more affordable electric cars hit the market, said Lucien Mathieu, a transport and e-mobility analyst at T&E.
That is good news, but the job is not yet done.
We need governments to help roll out electric vehicle charging at home and at work, and we need changes to car taxation to make electric cars even more attractive than polluting diesel, petrol or poor plug-in hybrid vehicles.
Even luxury sports carmakers are jumping on to the electric bandwagon.
This week, Lotus, owned by Chinese firm Geely, unveiled a £2m all-electric hypercar - the Evija - capable of more than 200mph (322km/h).
And in March, Automobili Pininfarina launched a similarly-priced electric hypercar - the Battista.
The message from these manufacturers is that electric can be glamorous and exciting, not just environmentally necessary, says our technology of business editor, Matthew Wall.
More from Rachel Fletcher, chief executive of Ofwat, who has been speaking to Today about the regulator's later proposals for the water companies.
How can they be made more accountable?
These are tough targets that we are setting as part of this price review, she says, including a further one-third reduction in pollution.
Those are targets that the companies will be held to, they'll be accountable, not just for reporting against their performance but they'll face tough penalties if they don't achieve those targets.
The regulator will step in where they fail to meet their obligations, she said.
Is Ofwat's longer-term approach akin to nationalisation?
Who owns the water companies is a matter for the government for the day.
How they perform, and pushing them to perform in customers' best interests, ...
is what Ofwat is all about, she said.
The average time spent participating in and consuming sport has grown by 22% over thelast 10 years - almost double the rate of overall leisure time growth (12%), according to data from sports agency Two Circles.
In the same period, global leisure time increased atan average growth rate of 1.1% year-on-year or 12% across the decade, it said.
Data shows that as technology and growing disposable incomeincreases the amount of free time the average person has to pursue recreational activities , the globalpopulation is turning to sport over other pastimes, they added.
This is due to a greater emphasis being placed onhealth and fitness, a greater supply of sports media, and sports growing cultural relevance.

A no-deal Brexit could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the financial crisis, the Bank of England has warned.
It said the UK economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath if there was no transition period, while house prices could fall by almost a third.
The Bank of England also warned the pound could fall by a quarter.
The Bank's analysis comes after the Treasury said the UK would be worse off under any form of Brexit.
This Bank's scenario is not what it expects to happen, but represents a worst-case scenario, based on a so called disorderly Brexit.
The scenario looks at the five-year period after the UK leaves the EU.
But by the end of 2023, the economy is expected to resume growing.
These are scenarios not forecasts.
They illustrate what could happen not necessarily what is most likely to happen.
Taken together the scenarios highlight that the impact of Brexit will depend on the direction, magnitude and speed of the effect of reduced openness of the UK economy, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said.
What is a 'disorderly Brexit'?
The Bank of England has made a number of assumptions - not forecasts - about what would cause a disorderly Brexit.
The UK reverts to World Trade Organization rules No new trade deals are implemented by 2022 The UK loses all access to existing trade agreements between the EU and third countries Severe disruption at borders because of customs checks Migration reverses from 150,000 a year to falling by 100,000 a year The Bank of England does not give a probability of this happening.
What happens during this disorderly scenario?
Scenarios drawn up by the Bank of England show that GDP would fall by 8% in 2019 against its current forecast.
Growth would quickly resume and the economy would expand again by the end of 2023 but be smaller than where it was before.
Unemployment would rise to 7.5%, house prices fall by 30% and commercial property prices collapse by 48%.
Interest rates would reach 4%.
What other scenarios did the Bank of England consider?
The Bank looked at three other scenarios.
a disruptive Brexit - one where the UK retained access to some trade agreements what might happen if trading arrangements were agreed to give the UK a close relationship what might happen if trading arrangements were agreed to give the UK a less close relationship A close relationship is one with no customs checks, no regulatory barriers and a partial deal agreed on financial services.
A less close relationship is one where customs checks start after 2021 and other regulatory checks are put in place.
What happens in these scenarios?
If Brexit is disruptive rather than disorderly, GDP falls 3% over the five years to 2022, house prices slide 14%, and unemployment reaches 5.75% If a close trading relationship is agreed, the economy could still be 1% smaller than if the UK had remained in the EU but 1.5% higher than the bank's most recent estimate.
If it is less close, the economy's growth could be 3.75% less than if the UK had remained in the EU and 0.75% less than forecast over the last inflation report.
These figures cover the period to 2023.
What does this mean for Theresa May?
By political reporter Brian Wheeler Theresa May will not have told the Bank's economists what to say in their report but it is definitely helpful to her.
The timing is significant too.
A leaked copy of Downing Street's media grid had today down as economy.
Tomorrow is security.
So expect a steady drumbeat of official warnings about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit in the run up to 11 December's vote.
Downing Street's hope is that however much they hate her deal (and they do) MPs will come to view it as the only safe option.
The problem is that these kind of warnings, however well-grounded in facts and figures, are too easily written off as project fear.
The more scary they sound, the easier they are to dismiss.
What has been the political reaction?
Conservative MP and Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused Mark Carney of talking down the pound - saying the Bank of England's warnings tonight lack all credibility.
Speaking to the BBC, Mr Rees-Mogg said project fear had become project hysteria.
And the pro-Brexit former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The bottom line of both sets of reports is that project fear like Frankenstein's monster has been resuscitated and is stalking the land.
However, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: The Bank has confirmed what other independent reports this week have been telling us: a no-deal Brexit could be even worse than the financial crisis of 10 years ago, and the country would be much worse under Theresa May's deal, he said.
What else did the Bank say?
Mr Carney said the Bank was monitoring markets and indicated that it was ready to lend to UK banks if necessary.
He also indicated that banks might be allowed to hold less capital if risks became too great.
But he warned there was little the Bank could do.
There is little monetary policy can do to offset the potentially significant hits to productivity and supply that Brexit could entail...
the future potential of this economy and its implications of jobs, real wages and wealth are not in the gift of central bankers, he said.
What does it mean for the banking sector?
The Bank of England has exposed seven major lenders to a stress test which it said was two and half times more severe than the Brexit scenarios.
All seven lenders - Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, Santander and Nationwide Building Society - passed the test.
Data - how it is created, stored, analysed and applied - will be a key theme in 2019, experts think.
Car dealership Lookers has said it will make less money than previously expected this year because of challenging conditions in the sector.
While the company said trading was good during the first three months of the year, trading in the second quarter was tougher, with new car registrations down 4.6% from a year earlier.
Lookers said it expected that the more recent challenging conditions are likely to continue into the second half, exacerbated by continued weakness in consumer confidence in light of wider political and economic uncertainty, and further pressure on used car margins.
The company added that its current outlook for underlying profit before tax for the full year is now below its previous expectations.

The claim: Leaks in England and Wales are down by a third.
Reality Check verdict: Leakages in England and Wales fell 38% - so more than a third - from their peak in 1994-95 to the current level, with most of the reductions coming in the first six years.
The UK is about average in Europe for the amount of water lost in this way.
As the hot weather continues, consumers are being asked to conserve water, even though United Utilities cancelled the hosepipe ban it had been planning to introduce in the north-west of England at the weekend.
There has been much discussion of the amount that the water companies themselves are wasting.
Robert Colvile, from the Centre for Policy Studies, was on Newsnight, championing the privatisation of the water companies on the basis that leaks were down by a third.
The water regulator Ofwat told Reality Check that leakage had peaked at 5,112 million litres per day in England and Wales in 1994-95, which was five years after the industry was privatised in 1989.
The regulator also said that 1994-95 was the first year for which reliable leakage figures were available.
The most recent figures are for 2017-18, when leakage was 3,183 million litres per day, so that's a fall of about 38% since peak leak.
But if you look at the chart, almost all of the fall in leakage had happened by 2000-01, with little reduction since then.
It has been suggested that this may be because the water companies were approaching the point at which it was no longer worth the money it would cost to reduce leaks further.
A report from the National Infrastructure Commission said: Analysis by water companies and Ofwat suggested that it would be cheaper to use more water than to reduce leakage.
However, it pointed out that this ignored the environmental benefits of not wasting water and the fact that leakage made consumers less likely to be prepared to reduce their own consumption.
It called on the companies to undertake to reduce leakage by 50% by 2050.
Nine of the 20 water companies in England and Wales missed their leakage targets in 2017-18, with Thames Water the worst offender.
The company was fined £120m by the regulator earlier this year for failing to manage leaks adequately.
All of the water companies face penalties or rewards based on their leakage performance as part of their outcome delivery incentives (ODIs) set by the regulator.
Water UK, which represents water companies, says that since privatisation companies have spent £150bn on improving services overall and continue to invest around £8bn a year, although the figures are not broken down into whether the money has been spent on fixing or preventing leaks.
A National Audit Office report in 2015 found that water bills had risen by 40% above inflation since privatisation.
Ofwat does not regulate Scottish Water or Northern Ireland Water, which have their own regulators and are publicly owned.
Scottish Water was set up in 2002, when leakage was at an estimated 1,132 million litres per day.
In 2017-18 it was 492 million litres a day, which is a fall of 57% and also below the target it had been set to cut leaks below 500 million litres per day by 2019-20.
Northern Ireland Water's leakage has fallen by 43% since 2001.
In the UK as a whole, about 23% of the water put into the public supply is lost because of leaks.
In England and Wales the figure is about 20%.
EurEau, which represents water services providers across Europe, compares figures for these losses for 22 European countries.
It turns out that by that measure, the UK is about average.
The organisation also compared the levels of bills across Europe.
While there are some caveats behind the figures, because the ways that bills are worked out are not straightforward, ranking countries by the size of average bills with the most expensive at the top, the UK comes about a third of the way down the list.

Online mortgage CEO Ishaan Malhi says one of the key things to get right is hiring the right people.
Stonegate Pub, which owns the Slug and Lettuce pub chain, is buying Ei- once known as Enterprise Inns - for £1.3bn.
Ei is the largest owner of pubs in the UK with over 4,000 properties across England and Wales.
Private equity-owned Stonegate is a managed pub company and has a national estate of over 765 outlets and began life in November 2010 following the acquisition by Stonegate of 333 pubs from Mitchells & Butlers.
The deal is priced at 285p-a-share - 38.5% premium on the share price on Wednesday night.
Including debt, the bid values Ei at £3bn.
Robert Walker, chairman of Ei, said: The commercial benefits of combining the companies are compelling.
Stonegate is committed to continuing to invest in the business for the future benefit of the combined business, tenants and employees.
Danske Bank has reported pre-tax profits of £45.9m for the firsthalf of 2019.
That's a 13% increase on £40.6m pre-tax profits for the same timelast year.
This is because of lower loan impairments this year.
Danske Bank has40 branches in Northern Ireland and employs 1,500 people.
The bank said lending is 5% higher year-on-year, but new lendingto businesses has been impacted by Brexit with some larger customers delayinginvestment decisions.
Danske Bank UK CEO Kevin Kingston said: Lending during the first six months of the year has beenpredominantly to existing business customers, some of whom are progressinggrowth ambitions, with others extending their facilities with us to ensure theyare prepared for any economic challenges associated with Brexit.
According to the ONS, the UK's overall trade deficit decreased by £4.6bn to £12.6bn for the three months to May 2019, due mainly to the trade in goods deficit narrowing by £4.6bn to £39.7bn.
The trade deficit narrowed due to falling imports of transport equipment, machinery and chemicals, as well as increased exports of fuels.
Growth in imports of unspecified goods, which includes non-monetary gold, also slowed in the three months to May 2019.
Only three out of 17 water firms in England and Wales have passed the latest review by regulator Ofwat.
All firms had to submit plans to cut bills for millions of consumers over the 2020-25 period, while reducing leaks and helping vulnerable customers.
Most failed to meet the regulator's requirements.
But plans from Severn Trent, United Utilities and South West Water were approved.
The rest have been told to go back to the drawing board.
In the coming months, the remaining water companies will have to strengthen their plans so they too deliver for customers, Ofwat said.
Four companies - Affinity Water, Hafren Dyfrdwy, Thames Water and Southern Water - have the most work to do in order to meet the tough challenges Ofwat has laid down for the sector.
Severn Trent has pledged to cut customers' bills by an average of £18 a year in real terms by the 2024-25 financial year as part of its business plan.
United Utilities has proposed a £43 cut, while South West Water's planned cut is £73.
More for less Ofwat chief executive Rachel Fletcher said: We have challenged all water companies to deliver more for less for customers over the next five years.
Three companies have already stepped up to the mark with high-quality plans and stretching commitments to customers for the next five years.
The rest of the sector now needs to meet this high standard so that customers across the country get better and more efficient services.
The remaining 14 firms must submit revised plans by 1 April.
Ofwat will say what it thinks of them in July, while its final word on the matter will come in December.
As well as price cuts, Ofwat wants to see leaks reduced by 15%, which it says would save enough water for three months' worth of daily showers for everyone in England and Wales.
It also wants more help for customers struggling to pay their bills, with forecasts suggesting there could be 1.5 million of them by 2024-25.
Thames Water executive Steve Robertson said the company was disappointed with Ofwat's assessment of its £11.7bn five-year business plan, which he said tackled leakage and pollution while keeping average bills flat.
He added: We remain committed to our forward-looking plan, which prioritises investment over everything else - including shareholder dividends.
We'll now study the feedback in detail and look forward to engaging constructively with Ofwat throughout this process.

Mr Barnier said the thrice-rejected withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May was the only way to leave the EU in an orderly manner.
How much does it cost to run an electric car?
How can I get a charging point when I don't have a driveway?
Are they really better for the environment?
These are just some of the many questions you have been sending us about electric cars, and with more and more manufacturers investing in and developing these vehicles, more questions are being raised.
This week the government announced it is pumping nearly £40m into improving the infrastructure for electric vehicles .
Business correspondent Theo Leggett and transport correspondent Tom Burridge have been answering some of the questions sent to us by BBC News online readers.
Phil: How much does it cost to put an electric charging point in your home?
Tom: The first thing to note is that the government provides a grant of £500.
A basic charging unit can cost around the £700 mark so in that case you would have to pay the remaining £200.
However the price of installation can vary depending on how far the charging point is from the mains supply.
Faster charging units can cost around £1,500 (minus the £500 grant).
If you don't buy a charging unit you can still charge your car from your mains supply using a simple bit of kit provided by the car manufacturer, but it will charge more slowly.
Sarah: What happens to electric car batteries at the end of their life?
Are they sent to landfill to pollute in a different way?
Tom: Under European Union law it is illegal for vehicle batteries to be incinerated or sent to landfill.
However, the UK currently has no specialist facilities which can commercially separate the metals in the battery for reuse.
The numbers of used lithium-ion electric car batteries produced in Britain are still relatively low.
Any old batteries can be exported to a European country which does have specialist recycling facilities.
The batteries are then incinerated at high temperatures and roughly 50% of each battery, including critical elements such as the cobalt and nickel, can be recovered.
The other option is to reuse the batteries.
After about 8 to 10 years a lithium-ion electric car battery's performance will drop significantly.
The battery is then not good enough to be used to power an electric vehicle.
However they can be used to store electricity.
For example, old electric car batteries are part of a back-up power system at the Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam.
In the UK, one waste management firm that I contacted, Cawleys, operates a service to safely collect, dismantle EV battery packs and work out which ones are good enough to be reused and which should be sent abroad for recycling.
Experts at the Faraday Institution's ReLiB project are leading UK research to develop more sophisticated techniques to recycle electric vehicle batteries.
But in short, recycling electric vehicle batteries in Britain is a work in progress.
John: I live in a mid-terrace house and am restricted to a public car park at the end of the street - how would I be able to charge an electric car?
Tom: With some difficulty is, for now at least, the short answer.
A colleague who lives in London did charge his car from his terraced house and covered the cable, which ran across the pavement, with basic safety kit to stop passing pedestrians from tripping up.
He okayed everything with his council but ultimately his neighbours weren't happy and he decided to give his electric car up.
Charging points installed inside lamp posts are being rolled-out on some streets in Coventry, Buckinghamshire and parts of London.
And the government has just awarded £40m to various companies to develop new technologies such as wireless charging panels and pop-up chargers built into the pavement.
If you have a public car park near your house then that is another reason for you to lobby your local council to install some charging points.
More charging infrastructure, especially for areas with no off-street parking is coming but it will take time and how fast it arrives on your street is, to some extent, a post-code lottery.
Emily: Can we produce enough electricity to support everyone having an electric car?
Theo: There are currently 31.5 million cars on the road in Britain, according to the DVLA - and 31 million of them are still petrol or diesel powered.
If we are to replace all of them with electric models, of course we will need plenty of power.
But it isn't just a question of how much electricity will be required.
When it will be needed is just as important.
If 31 million people come home and charge their cars at the same time, the load on the network will be enormous, but if that demand can be spread through the day, then the strain will be much less.
George Beard from the non-profit Transport Research Laboratory suggests customers could be incentivised to charge their vehicle at non-peak times or even hand control of the charging to their energy supplier.
Two technologies are likely to come to the fore here.
Smart charging will enable cars to draw electricity from the grid at times of day when supplies are plentiful or when overall demand is relatively low.
Vehicle-to-Grid should allow electric cars to act as power banks , not only taking power from the grid, but returning some of that electricity at peak times, to alleviate strain on the system - while making sure that the car is fully charged when it is actually needed.
The National Grid publishes annual future energy scenarios, in which it attempts to crunch the numbers and work out how much power we will actually need.
Its latest assessment says that by 2050 overall electricity demand from transport will rise by between 22% and 30% a year - but PEAK demand could increase by as little as 6% or as much as 22%.
That does mean we will need to generate more power.
National Grid expects a significant increase in solar and wind generation across its scenarios - but it also assumes new nuclear plants will be built to replace our current ageing reactors.
It believes a minimum of 7GW of new nuclear capacity will be built - or more than double the expected output of the Hinkley Point C station that is currently under construction.
Lucille: Can petrol cars be converted to use electricity?
Theo: In theory, there's no reason why you couldn't take the engine out of your car, fit an electric motor and a bunch of batteries, and drive it away.
There are even instructions on how to do it available on the internet .
But while that might be an entertaining challenge for the home mechanic, it's unlikely to be the best option for your average driver.
Part of the challenge in building an electric car is maximising the energy available from the battery pack, to give the best compromise between range and performance, as well as maximising battery life.
The new models being built by both mainstream manufacturers like VW and Daimler, and by technology sector interlopers such as Tesla, rely on sophisticated software to do all of this.
Your home conversion is unlikely to have the same technological wizardry on board.
Another issue is weight.
Electric cars need lots of batteries, and batteries are heavy.
Carmakers have put a lot of effort into making sure that this weight doesn't affect the handling of the car too much.
Again, it's hard to do properly at home.
Of course, some manufacturers have themselves converted existing designs to electric power.
But that involves compromises - and most of the new models coming onto the market over the next few years will be bespoke electric designs.
Mark: When can we expect the range of an electric car to be over 300 miles (483km)?
Theo: In theory, you can already, though it might cost you a fair bit.
Tesla claims its Model S Long Range will do 375 miles on a charge, when measured using the new WLTP standard which manufacturers must now use under EU law.
In the real world it may be rather less than that, but still in the 300 mile ballpark.
The problem is, it costs more than £80,000.
If you want something more affordable, the Nissan Leaf costs about £31,000 - but the standard model has a theoretical range of just 168 miles.
The E+ version can do up to 239 miles, but costs about £8,000 more.
So you get what you pay for.
But it's worth remembering that carmakers are falling over themselves to develop new electric cars at the moment - and as the technology becomes more widespread, it will also become cheaper.
It wouldn't be surprising if a 300 mile range becomes the norm pretty quickly.
Ian: How can electric cars be environmentally friendly when the electricity that powers them comes from power stations that burn fossil fuels?
Roger Harrabin, the BBC's environment analyst, responded to this question: While electric vehicles don't produce tailpipe emissions like traditional cars, the electricity to power the vehicles has to come from somewhere.
This means that there are upstream emissions.
However, the European Federation for Transport and Environment analysed data from a number of studies and found that a battery electric car over its lifetime produces 50% less CO2 emissions than an average EU car today.
It is also worth bearing in mind that in the first five months of 2019, Britain generated more power from zero-carbon sources than fossil fuels.
However, the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions points out that drivers still tend to be choosing hybrid vehicles - rather than pure electric cars - and that will lock in fossil fuel usage into the future.

Economist Dr Can Van Luc said 70 percent of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) , equivalent to nearly 400,000 businesses, find it difficult to get credit.
The outstanding loans to SMEs accounted for 22-25 percent of total outstanding loans in the 2012-2017 period.
This was partly due to the small size of the enterprises, which makes it difficult for banks to use financial indicators to grade and rate them when considering loans.
The lack of information transparency and collateral, and the infeasibility of their projects cause credit institutions to say no to small businesses, Vu Tien Loc, chairman of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), said at a recent forum on Solutions to Promote Small and Medium Sized Enterprises.
Bui Thu Thuy, deputy director of the Ministry of Planning and Investments Enterprise Development Agency, said businesses need to have a mechanism to share information with banks and build a database on assets, equity capital, turnover, annual profits, operational status, etc.
According to statistics from the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, 600,000 SMEs account for 97.5 percent of the country's total number of enterprises.
Every year SMEs create over one million new jobs and account for more than 40 percent of the GDP, 30 percent of the governments revenues, 33 percent of industrial output, and 30 percent of exports.
The total capital of SMEs is around $121 billion, accounting for 30 percent of the registered capital of all enterprises.
But despite playing an important role in the economy, SMEs are struggling to grow.
A recent survey of over 504 enterprises in many fields by the VCCI found that the biggest obstacle to growth for SMEs was funding.
Loc said 60 percent of SMEs cannot access funding, which is the responsibility of the government, banks and the companies themselves.
To help businesses address this issue, the VCCI recently carried out a project called Supporting Vietnamese Enterprises to Improve Access to Credit, Enhancing Management Capacity and Financial Transparency.
Vu Tien Loc, president of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), made this proposal at a recent meeting with former Italian Prime Minister, Enrico Letta.
This would enable Italian enterprises to support their Vietnamese counterparts and exchange experiences on European technologies and production processes, helping Vietnamese products enter the EU market, he said.
2018 marks 45 years of diplomatic relations and five years of strategic ties between Vietnam and Italy.
Letta said Vietnam has a strategic position in Asia and many free trade agreements.
The Europe-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) and Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) would be good opportunities for Italian investors, he said.
Michele DErcol, president of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam (ICHAM), told the media recently that given the reduction of tariffs to zero percent under the deal Italy could export many products to Vietnam such as machinery, wood products, fabric and garments.
Italian companies can also make use of their technological strengths to help Vietnam develop some sectors, especially agriculture, he added.
The EVFTA, expected to come into force next year, will eliminate almost all tariffs between the EU and Vietnam.
Upon entry into force of the deal, 65 percent of the value of EU exports will enter Vietnam duty-free, and the remaining will be gradually eliminated over a maximum period of 10 years.
The FTA will also reduce non-tariff barriers for EU exports.
The Italy - ASEAN Association is preparing for the High-level dialogue on Italy-ASEAN economic relations next June in Hanoi.
It is expected to strengthen the relationship between the two countries and provide an opportunity to bolster cooperation between ASEAN and Italy on the one hand and Italy and Vietnam on the other.
Italy is now Vietnams fourth biggest European economic partner.
Bilateral trade was worth around $5 billion last year.
With registered investment capital of $389 million, Italy ranks 31st out of 126 countries and territories directly investing in Vietnam.
The organizer, The Asian Banker, said the event, with the theme Unlocking the potential in Vietnams Digital Economy, would look at the financial ecosystem being driven by the adoption of digital technology and strategy, two key elements leading to a cashless society.
The key focus areas will include a new financial system rebuilt by financial technology, the road to cashless society through digital payment, opportunities for and obstacles to financial inclusion in Vietnam, and innovations in acquiring and retaining customers.
Vietnams unique convergence of stellar economic growth, a large number of unbanked and young population, high mobile and internet penetration as well as supportive regulatory environment makes the country a perfect place for fintech startups, the organizer stated on the forum's website.
While the country is still dealing with debt problems, financial institutions and local government have realized that the innovation in fintech can bring Vietnams financial services industry to a prosperous path, it added.
There will also be a pre-conference workshop for bankers on Transforming Vietnams Economy and Industry – Innovation & Capability Development for SMEs on January 9.
Several high-profile speakers have confirmed their presence at the event, including Nguyen Kim Anh, Deputy Governor of the State Bank of Vietnam.
This year The Asian Banker Vietnam country awards, part of the event, will cover primarily retail financial services and financial technologies.
They will be presented to more than 10 industry leaders at a gala dinner on January 10.
The forum will be held with the support of the Vietnam Banks Association and is expected to welcome more than 150 industry players and policy makers.
The Asian Banker is the region's leading provider of strategic business intelligence to the financial services community.

One autumn day in 1865, two men sat in a tavern in Ansonia, Connecticut, calming their nerves with a few stiff drinks.
They had been riding a wagon down a nearby hill when they heard a blood-curdling scream from behind them.
What appeared to be the devil himself - with the head of a man and the body of some unknown creature - was flying down the hill towards them, skimming low over the ground.
They whipped their horses and fled, while the devil plunged off the road and into a flooded ditch.
Imagine their fear when the devil himself then came over to introduce himself: the dark-haired Frenchman was bleeding and soaking wet.
His name was Pierre Lallement.
The young mechanic had been in the United States for a few months, and had brought with him from France a machine of his own devising - a pedal-cranked, two wheeled construction he called a velocipede.
We would call it a bicycle.

Monsieur Lallement was soon to patent his invention, which still lacked the gears and chain drive of a modern bicycle.
It also lacked brakes - which was why he had plunged down the hill towards the waggoneers with such hellish speed.
His rather cumbersome model was soon superseded by the Penny Farthing, which was not the genteel vehicle we imagine through the sepia tint of nostalgia.
Courtesy of the enormous front wheel, it was a racing machine - twice as fast as a velocipede.
It was ridden almost exclusively by fearless young men, perched on top of a five-foot wheel and prone to pitching forward at the slightest obstacle.
But the next technological step, the safety bicycle, had much broader appeal.
It looked much like modern bicycles do, with a chain drive, equally-sized wheels, and a diamond frame.
Speed came not from a gargantuan wheel, but from gears.
Safety bicycles could even be ridden in a dress.
Not that that worried Angeline Allen, who caused a sensation in 1893 by cycling around Newark, on the outskirts of New York City, without one.
She wore trousers! bellowed the headline of a popular titillating men's magazine, adding that she was young, pretty, and divorced.
The bicycle was a liberating force for women.
They needed to shed their whalebone girdles and hoop-reinforced skirts in favour of something simpler and more comfortable.
They would ride without chaperones, too.
The forces of conservatism were alarmed, fretting that immodest bicycling would lead to masturbation, even prostitution.
But these protests soon seemed laughable.
As cycling historian Margaret Guroff points out, nobody seemed concerned about what Ms Allen was doing - only what she was wearing while she did it.
A woman seen alone in public on a safety bicycle seemed no scandal at all.
Three years later, the elderly Susan B Anthony, a women's rights activist for most of the 19th Century, declared that bicycling had done more to emancipate woman than any one thing in the world.
The bicycle continues to empower young women today.
In 2006, the state government of Bihar, India, began to heavily subsidise the purchase of bicycles for teenage girls transferring to secondary school - the idea being that the bikes would allow girls to travel several miles to their lessons.
The programme seems to have worked, dramatically increasing the chances that girls will stick with secondary school.
Even in America, the bicycle is an inexpensive way to expand horizons: the basketball superstar LeBron James has founded a school in his hometown in Ohio that supplies a bike to every student.
He says that when he and his friends were on their bikes, they were free.
We felt like we were on top of the world.
Yes, the bicycle has long been a liberating technology for the economically downtrodden.
In its early days, it was much cheaper than a horse, yet offered the same range and freedom.
The bicycle ushered in a manufacturing revolution as well as a social one.
In the first half of the 19th Century, precision-engineered interchangeable parts were being used to make military-grade firearms for the US Army, at considerable expense.
Interchangeability proved too costly, at first, for civilian factories to emulate fully.
It was the bicycle that served as the bridge between high-end military manufacture, and widespread mass production of complex products.
More things that made the modern economy: Bicycle manufacturers developed simple, easily repeatable techniques - such as stamping cold sheet metal into new shapes - to keep costs low without sacrificing quality.
They also developed ball bearings, pneumatic tyres, differential gears and brakes.
Both the manufacturing techniques and these innovative components were embraced in due course by auto manufacturers such as Henry Ford.
The first safety bicycle was made in 1885 at the Rover factory in Coventry, England.
It is no coincidence that Rover went on to become a major player in the car industry; the progression from making bikes to making cars was obvious.
The bicycle provided stepping stones for modernising Japanese industry, too.
The first step was the importing of Western bikes to Tokyo in around 1890.
Then it became useful to establish bicycle repair shops.
The next step was to begin making spares locally - not too much trouble for a skilled mechanic.
Only 10 years later, all the ingredients existed to make the bicycles in Tokyo itself.
By the outbreak of World War Two, Japan was making more than a million bikes a year, masterminded by a new class of businessman.
It is tempting to view the bicycle as the technology of the past.
The data shows otherwise.
Half a century ago, world production of bikes and cars was about the same - 20 million each, per year.
Production of cars has since tripled, but production of bicycles has increased twice as fast again - to around 120 million a year.
And it is not absurd to suggest that bicycles are pointing the way yet again.
As we seem to stand on the brink of an age of self-driving cars , many people expect that the vehicle of the future will not be owned, but rented, with the click of a smartphone app.
If so, the vehicle of the future is here: globally well over a thousand bike-share schemes and tens of millions of dockless, easy-to-rent bikes are now thought to be in circulation, with numbers growing fast.
You can even hire battery-powered models.
Ride-sharing firm Uber has already announced that it plans to to focus more on its electric scooter and bike business, and less on cars.
Some companies have experienced teething problems with the business model.
Large number of bikes have been stolen, vandalised or abandoned, leading firms to pull back from operating in certain cities.
However, the market seems set to grow, given that the bicycle is still often the quickest way to get around gridlocked areas.
Many cyclists are discouraged only by diesel fumes and by the prospect of, like Monsieur Lallement, crashing.
But if the next generation of automobile is a pollution-free electric model, driven by a cautious and considerate robot, it may be that the bicycle's popularity - just like Pierre Lallement on his downhill ride - is about to pick up speed.

Economics got some really basic things wrong, and some economists are now trying to put them right, says Evan Davis, Presenter of Radio 4's PM programme and former Economics Editor of BBC News.
Two caveats before I get stuck in.
First, I should say that I love economics.
It is a kit of wonderful tools for making sense of the world - you can look up some of the more alluring concepts, from the prisoners' dilemma to comparative advantage to the paradox of thrift.
It goes without saying that we should not want to throw economics away.
Secondly, economics has not had a bad run.
Over the last few decades, economists have (more than ever and more than anyone else) had an influence over every aspect of our lives.
They've run the central banks, they have led thinking about business and they work at the top echelons of civil services across the West and in international institutions.
Their orthodoxy has underpinned all sorts of government policies (like choice in education for example).
And during this era in which economists have reigned, the world has notched up some marked successes.
The reduction in the proportion of human beings living in abject poverty over the last thirty years has been extraordinary.
But for all this, economics is rightly in the midst of a re-think.
It was obvious a lot had gone wrong at the time of the financial crisis; it was a professional embarrassment that the worst crash in three generations occurred not too long after economists took over in the cockpit.
And then just as significantly, a decade on from that crisis, we know that the orthodox economic model (the one that many people call neoliberal) is leaving swathes of people in large parts of all western societies dissatisfied.
Obviously, politics and policy-makers are responding to the anger in the usual way - trying to fumble their way to something different.
The big inquiry into inequality that was launched by the Institute for Fiscal Studies recently is an example of the changing priorities of economists who work at the practical end of the profession.
But there is something else going on as well: the whole academic discipline of economics is being re-considered: the theory as well as the policy advice.
Not all economists are on board with this project, and not all economics is being overthrown.
And not all the rethinking is actually new.
But it does seem that we are in the midst of a slow paradigm shift.
Who knows where it will end?
The two 'Cs' Two words - both beginning with C - capture the critiques of old school thinking.
One is complexity, the other is community.
Let me explain both.
Complexity is a reaction against some very simplistic assumptions upon which the orthodox economic models are built: in particular the assumptions that individuals know what they want, that they maximise their utility subject to the constraints on income and time they face and that companies maximise profits.
Traditional economic models need to be simple to make the maths work, and getting the maths to work has always felt like an important objective.
In addition, a huge weight in these models has been put on internal consistency, rather than practical applicability.
But it turns out that the world is more complicated than these simplistic assumptions imply.
This is very clear in the most basic function of economic models, to help us understand the economy.
Economists have always produced their models in the form of a kind of virtual black box containing dozens of equations.
Into this, they can plug some data and out of the box come projections of how the economy will behave in different circumstances.
These models have a certain theoretical elegance but there is now an increasing sense that economies do not evolve along a well-defined mathematical path, but in a far more messy way.
The individual players within the economy face radical uncertainty; they adapt and learn as they go; they watch what everybody else does.
The economy stumbles along in a process of slow discovery, full of feedback loops.
The new models might draw on other sciences - they might analyse how schools of fish or flocks of birds move together; or they might draw on evolutionary models of populations.
Take an example: how do companies decide when to put up their prices?
This is central to understanding inflation.
Simplifying a bit here, in the traditional models businesses might make their pricing decisions by looking at the inflation target and assuming that is what inflation will be.
Or they might just stick with yesterday's prices, as it costs a lot to change the labels on their products.
Economists think hard about this kind of thing - with rational companies making clever pricing decisions.
But in the new models, you don't assume companies ultimately know what the right price is - they are guessing, they are watching each other and learning as they go.
There are multiple paths inflation could follow.
Or take another important area: finance.
Economists have tended to think the stock market is efficient: the price of company share on any day, is seen as the best possible guess of the value of that company share at the time.
How could it be any different?, the logic goes.
If the company was worth more than the share price implied, then people would buy the shares, driving the share price up until it was just at the right level.
But again, the real world is more complicated: who actually makes the investment decisions?
By the time you have factored in the layers of financial intermediaries who look after money on our behalf, competing for our business, you see all sorts of distorted incentives.
Fund managers might want to follow the pack of other investors rather than following their own judgements in order not to be left looking stupid.
Suddenly, you have the potential for bubbles, booms and busts as everybody piles into the same shares at the same time.
Or take GDP (gross domestic product), the most basic measure of national income.
It is barely an exaggeration to say it has been fetishised in economics, despite obvious weaknesses in its capacity to encapsulate a whole economy in a single number.
A lot of re-thinking is going on there, particularly as companies like Google and Facebook stretch the concept of market transactions, where we get so much for free, but where we give back a lot of useful data without charge.
So nothing is simple, and economists are having to learn that a dishevelled model of the economy may be more useful than a tidy one.
Group identity Which brings us to the second issue: community.
It turns out that people do not just act as individuals.
They value their sense of belonging to a society; they have a sense of group interest, they are happy to make obligations to the rest of the group, and the group identity shapes their decision-making.
And you can't just assume that away.
So for example, the dominant old paradigm in understanding company behaviour has been to assume everything the company does is for the shareholders.
Indeed, many economists have allowed themselves to go from simplistically assuming this is what companies do, to arguing that this is what companies ought to do.
Under the new thinking, there is a sense that this has led companies the wrong way: they are themselves complex communities, and operate within complex societies.
Their objectives need to be defined in a far more nuanced way.
You will even find economists attacking the notion of the invisible hand: it's an appealing metaphor that has implied the default setting for any commerce should be laissez-faire; that left to their own devices, selfish individuals unwittingly produce the best outcome for society as a whole.
But the new thinking suggests that government, or some notion of group interest should have a bigger part to play in getting things to run efficiently.
So when it comes to both complexity and community, economists' preoccupations are changing.
I don't want to pretend that the new thinking represents a sudden, sharp jolt.
Economists have always been expert at self-criticism, and their subject is always evolving.
And I'm not making an original argument here: I'm simply reporting what I hear economists say about how they feel their subject is changing.
Many non-economists will say that the economists must have been stupid not to realise what was wrong with their subject.
All that I've set out here should have been obvious.
But of course, economics has not been wrong about everything.
Simplistic models can often offer genuinely useful insights.
The problem is that the profession has sometimes taken them too literally, and hoped narrow models will bear more weight than they were ever designed to carry.
At the end of the day, it is very easy to make the mistake of the old drunk looking for his keys under a streetlight.
Are you sure this is where you dropped them?
No, I dropped them in the park, but the light is better here, he says.
Economists have put more weight on looking where the light is good - than where the economy is.
And it is great that they are now beginning to look elsewhere.
On 1 January, when Brazil's far-right president Jair Bolsonaro took office, many in the country were concerned that the divisive politician would not be able to bring the country together.
But one sector was almost unanimous in praising Mr Bolsonaro's rise to power: business people.
Brazil's president boasted during the election that he did not understand anything about economics.
Once in power, he delegated all decisions on the subject to businessman Paulo Guedes, who became a super-minister of the economy.
The task of rescuing Brazil's economy from the brink of yet another recession was urgent.
The economy is still at the same level it was back in 2014.
Markets were excited at the prospects of liberal reforms to come.
But expectations soon started to fall apart.
A series of government blunders - political infighting inside the administration, a clumsy attempt at state intervention in Brazil's fuel policy and the lack of leadership in Congress - hampered growth expectations.
Most analysts have halved their growth expectations for Brazil and now believe significant growth will not start until 2020.
Here is a look at some of the key figures that suggest Brazil's economy is not moving forward.
There's no economic recovery in sight In the previous decade, Brazil was lauded (along with Russia, India, China and South Africa) as one of the Brics powers - emerging economies with superfast rates of economic growth that would surpass developed economies by 2050.
The economic performance of this decade, however, suggests Brazil does not belong in that league.
A crippling two-year recession in 2015 and 2016 saw the country's economy contract by almost 7%.
Economic recovery has been sluggish.
In 2017 and 2018, the economy grew at a meagre pace of 1.1% a year.
And there is still more bad news: since the beginning of the year, economists have more than halved their expectations of economic growth for 2019 to a rate not very different from that seen in the past two years.
The unemployment problem isn't being solved Brazilian workers are the ones paying the price.
The number of unemployed people has increased from 7.6 million in 2012 to 13.4 million this year.
Mr Bolsonaro thinks these numbers actually underestimate the real picture.
He believes the situation is worse.
The official unemployment survey shows that 28.3 million people are under-utilised - which means they are either not working or working less than they could.
There are fewer people with formal jobs, while wages are barely keeping up with inflation - which has been brutal.
Since the beginning of Brazil's recession four years ago, prices have gone up by 25%.
The currency and stock market have dashed post-election hopes During much of the election, the Brazil's currency - the real - rallied strongly as it became clear that Mr Bolsonaro would win the election.
It was a clear sign of confidence from investors abroad.
A poll by Bloomberg late last year among chief international strategists saw Brazil top the list of best bets in three categories: foreign exchange, bonds and stocks.
After almost five months, prospects are now bleak.
Both the stock exchange and the currency - which usually anticipate the pace in the real economy - are close to the same level they were at the beginning of this year.
Brazil's stock exchange hit an all-time high in March this year, but has returned most of its gains following disappointing corporate results.
Still mired in debt So why is Brazil in such a mess in the first place?
The main consensus among market analysts - and also people in Mr Bolsonaro's government - is that the country started spending too much money around 2013, during the leftist government of Dilma Rousseff.
Since then, one of the main thermometers of Brazil's economy has been the fiscal deficit - the amount of money spent beyond the country's revenues.
Ms Rousseff was impeached amid allegations that she masked Brazil's fiscal deficit to hide how much her government was overspending.
Since her downfall, all efforts from the government have gone into lowering this fiscal deficit.
Some economists say the main culprit is the pension system, with Brazilians retiring too early (some in their early 50s) and with too many benefits (especially amongst civil servants).
Mr Bolsonaro is proposing pension cuts and a minimal retirement age of 65 for men and 62 for women.
During the boom years, Brazil had a debt which was 51% the size of its economy.
The growing fiscal deficit raised the debt level to 77.1%.
The government says that if nothing is done, the country's debt will be the size of its entire economy by 2023.
In recent years, Dunk Island off Australia's Queensland coast has been the private holiday retreat of its owners.
Prior to 2011, the picturesque island that lies near the country's Great Barrier Reef, had a 160-room resort.
But it was destroyed that year by a cyclone.
At the time tourism across the wider region was struggling.
So instead of refurbishing the hotel, the owners pocketed the insurance payout and decided to enjoy Dunk for themselves.
Now it's on the market with an asking price of around $20m Australian dollars ($14m; £11m).
Tom Gibson, who is managing the sale at estate agency group JLL, says the lucky bidder will get the old bones of the resort, a Qantas-built airstrip, mains power, and a sewage treatment plant.
He says the current owners want to sell to someone who can bring the operation back to life.
Dunk's fortunes form part of a picture of decline that mars resorts along Australia's iconic reef.
It is one of a string of retreats that have fallen into ruin as powerful cyclones and rising competition have damaged tourism.
Investment has suffered, and a handful of island hotels lie derelict.
We can't rely on past glories as the quintessential holiday destination for Australians, says Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council.
This is actually a race and we have to stay fit, he says, adding it has taken us a little while to realise that and respond.
Roughly the size of Italy, the Great Barrier Reef stretches 2,300km (1,400 miles) along the Queensland coastline.
Central to island tourism on the world's largest coral reef is the cluster of resorts in the Whitsundays.
Right now, Mr Gschwind says that four of the seven Whitsunday Islands that have tourist accommodation are closed.
That's partly due to severe cyclones that have battered the region, notably Cyclone Debbie in 2017.
Yet the devastation it caused went far beyond damage to property, Mr Gschwind explains, as coverage of natural disasters can knock tourism long after the sunshine has returned.
Those perception impacts for our industry are often more catastrophic than the physical damage caused, he says.
Mr Gschwind adds that some businesses suffer no damage, but stand on the brink of collapse as tourists stay away for fear it's unpleasant or unsafe.
It's depressing when you go to these places and it's bright sunshine, it's warm and people are sitting around with no customers for no apparent reason.
Wild weather isn't the only factor that has dampened island tourism.
A strong Australian dollar, coupled with a surge in budget air fares, dealt a heavy blow to many tourism operators.
Observers say that intensified about a decade ago, when instead of holidaying at home, Australians could afford more exotic trips to places like Bali or Phuket.
For international travellers, Australia looked too pricey.
The strength of the currency is the biggest driver in the Australian tourism market, says Sam Charlton, co-owner of Bedarra Island, a 10-villa luxury resort off the north Queensland coast.
Mr Charlton and his wife Kerri-Ann took over Bedarra in 2011.
At that time, the global financial crisis was weighing on tourism, and the high dollar made matters worse.
He says when Cyclone Yasi hit in 2011 it created the perfect storm of negatives for island operators.
It was the start of a period of deterioration for many resorts in the region.
With tourist arrivals thinning and money drying up, upkeep began to slip.
The result now is a collection of islands that have buildings on them that haven't been looked after for 10 years, Mr Charlton says.
Some islands closed when times were tougher, he says, and now there's a lot of work to do to revive the industry.
But much of that work has begun.
Investment is flowing back into the region through a wave of redevelopment.
Daydream Island resort officially reopened this month, and Great Keppel - a former party island with the marketing slogan Get wrecked on Keppel! - was bought by a Singaporean-Taiwanese company in 2018.
An Intercontinental resort on Hayman Island is due to open next month, and Lindeman Island is slated for a A$583m revamp.
Another, Long Island, is reportedly on the market for around A$15m.
Mr Gibson's firm JLL has managed a number of Queensland island sales over the past few years.
He says the region let the guard down a bit from 2005 onwards with the lack of reinvestment, but that's changing.
This month, the Queensland government said it would invest more than A$55m to partner with the private sector to restore these resorts to their former glory.
Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Already, tourism is picking up.
Industry group Tourism and Events Queensland says 7.7 million people visited the regions connected to the Great Barrier Reef in 2018 - up 13% year-on-year.
That's providing a boost to a valuable sector.
A 2017 Deloitte report found the Great Barrier Reef supports 64,000 jobs and contributed A$6.4bn annually to the Australian economy.
Still, some are worried about the impact of change.
Conservation groups have raised concerns over plans to develop islands such as Hinchinbrook, one of Australia's largest island national parks, by leasing them to commercial interests.
The health of the reef itself is also in sharp focus.
The threat of climate change and rising sea temperatures following widespread coral bleaching has sparked concerns about its future.
Those fears aren't helping the tourism industry, Bedarra Island's Mr Charlton says.
It's frustrating as a resort owner that there is all this press that the reef is dying… it's not.
He argues the reef is actually in really good condition.
The poor old reef has copped a lot of negative publicity that it doesn't deserve.
To the point where we get guests coming to see the reef before it's all gone.
And then they get back from their reef trip and they say it's spectacular, it's full of life and colour - and it is.
Two million low-paid workers could receive statutory sick pay for the first time.
Currently, employees must earn at least the equivalent of 14 hours on the minimum wage to qualify.
But the government is looking at whether to extend eligibility to those earning below this threshold.
There could also be more help for those returning to work after sick leave.
The government has launched a consultation on the proposed changes.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: We need to remove the barriers that stop people with disabilities or health conditions from reaching their full potential - these steps will help us achieve that.
Workers need to earn at least £118 a week to receive statutory sick pay, although the threshold is reviewed every tax year.
The Department for Work and Pensions said the proposals would cover gig workers on freelance or short-term contracts, as long as they met certain criteria.
About 1.1 million people in the UK are considered gig economy workers, receiving little or no holiday or sick pay from their employers.
Sick pay: What are my rights?
To qualify for statutory sick pay (SSP) you must be classed as an employee Agency workers are also entitled to SSP You need to earn at least £118 per week to be eligible for SSP You need to have been ill for at least four days in a row, including non-working days to claim SSP SSP is £94.25 a week.
If your employer has a sick pay scheme you may get more The maximum amount of time you can claim SSP for is 28 weeks here Phased returns to work The government is also looking at making statutory sick pay more flexible, as it seeks to reduce the number of people quitting work after a period of sickness.
Each year more than 100,000 people leave their job after a sickness absence lasting at least four weeks, it said.
It will explore allowing phased returns to work, in which people would continue to receive statutory sick pay, as well as offering small businesses who help employees return to work a rebate.
It will also consider whether to change legal guidance to encourage employers to intervene early during a period of sickness absence.
For example, employees could be given the right to request modifications to their working patterns - similar to the right to request flexible working - to help them return to work.
Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director at lobby group the CBI, said managing sickness absence effectively made good business sense.
Facebook's planned Libra cryptocurrency faced further opposition on Monday when the US treasury secretary warned about its potential criminal use.
Steven Mnuchin told a press conference it could be used by money launderers and terrorist financiers and said it was a national security issue.
He was not comfortable about Libra, joining President Donald Trump and the US central bank in voicing concern.
Facebook executives will appear before a congressional committee on Tuesday.
David Marcus, who will oversee Libra, is expected to tell the Senate Banking Committee that Facebook will not launch the currency until regulatory concerns are addressed.
Mr Mnuchin said Libra would have to convince financial regulators it has high privacy standards.
He declined to comment on any regulatory timeline for Libra, but said he was not comfortable today about digital currency and that Facebook was a long way away from securing approval.
Cryptocurrencies generally have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity like cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs and human human trafficking, Mr Mnuchin said.
Failure to act Last week, Mr Trump tweeted that he was not a fan of cryptocurrencies, and hinted that Facebook might need a banking licence.
Jerome Powell, head of the Federal Reserve, also said last week that Libra raises many serious concerns.
The tech giant, which hoped to launch Libra next year, has said it anticipated critical feedback and is keen to have conversations with officials and regulators.
In prepared testimony released on Monday ahead of Tuesday's senate hearing, Mr Marcus said: The Libra Association, which will manage the Libra reserve, has no intention of competing with any sovereign currencies or entering the monetary policy arena.
Monetary policy is properly the province of central banks, he said.
Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.
Mr Marcus said the US must lead innovation in digital currencies, adding: If we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different.
Christine Lagarde has said she will step down as managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
It comes ahead of a decision on her nomination to become head of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Ms Lagarde said she would leave the IMF on 12 September.
With greater clarity now on the process for my nomination as ECB president and the time it will take, I have made this decision in the best interest of the fund, she said.
The executive board will now be taking the necessary steps to move forward with the process for selecting a new managing director.
The former French cabinet minister has been head of the IMF since 2011.
If the European Council approves her ECB nomination, she will become the central bank's first ever female leader, responsible for the euro and the monetary policy of the eurozone.
Known as the rock star of international finance, Ms Lagarde, 63, began her career as a lawyer before moving into politics.
She served in various ministerial posts under Nicolas Sarközy before being elected as the first female boss of the IMF - replacing Dominique Strauss Khan.
Analysis by Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent Who will take over at the IMF?
The nominations will start coming in soon enough.
But the selection raises once again an old sore in arrangements for the leadership of the IMF and the World Bank.
There was a post-Second World War understanding - or carve-up if you prefer - that the top job at the IMF would go to a European, while an American would run the World Bank.
Christine Lagarde continued that tradition.
She was the IMF's fifth French managing director.
The issue was last reopened earlier this year, when a vacancy suddenly arose at the top of the World Bank.
President Trump's nominee, David Malpass got the job.
There have been challenges to the established practice.
When Ms Lagarde was selected, the Mexican central banker Agustin Carstens ran against her, and there were non-European nominations before that.
It would not be a surprising if there were more this time.
So far, however the post war deal has held up.
Consistently ranked among the top 10 most powerful women globally, Ms Lagarde has helped to rebuild the IMF's credibility following Greece's 2010 bailout, which bent the fund's rules.
She also presided over the IMF's biggest bailout, a $57bn deal for Argentina last year that many credited with arresting emerging market turbulence.
Last year, she was reported to have said no, no, no no, no no when asked if she was interested in running the European Central Bank (ECB).
However, she later described receiving the nomination as an honour.
The role is likely to test the silver-haired 63-year-old, who has admitted before that she lacks economic experience.
Dark clouds are hovering over Italy's banking sector and the bloc is in the midst of a slowdown.
However, one former IMF official said her leadership of the fund meant she was exceptionally qualified to run the ECB.
Christine Lagarde's career 1956: Born in Paris 1973: Wins scholarship to exclusive US school for a year, where she perfects her English 1981: After law school in Paris, joins international law firm Baker & McKenzie as an associate, becoming chair 18 years later 2005: Becomes France's trade minister in 2005 2007: Becomes France's finance minister, the first woman to hold this post not just in France but in any of the G8 major industrial countries 2011: Becomes head of the IMF 2019: Nominated to become president of the European Central Bank
Young Vietnam pros use social media to advance careers: report By Sen &nbspJune 29, 2019 | 06:00 pm GMT+7 The report affirms social media impact on Vietnamese people, especially the Gen Z population.

A survey has found 48.1 percent of Gen Z use social media to source career information, just 18.8 percent favor schools.
The newly-released report by staffing firm Adecco also found the generation (birth years from 1990s to mid-2000s) relied the least on their peers, with only 17.9 percent resorting to friends for career information.
The finding corresponds with the strong attachment to social media that Vietnamese citizens have shown in recent years.
As of January 2019, Vietnamese were spending almost seven hours online a day on average, of which 2.5 hours were spent on social media across all devices, according to a report by We Are Social.
The UK-based social media marketing agency also said YouTube and Facebook, with 96 percent and 95 percent of Internet users who report using each respectively, are their most active platforms.
Vietnam has 62 million social media users in total.
Adecco's survey polled a total of 1,234 people in Vietnams biggest cities Hanoi, Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh City who were born between 1965 and 2015.
Of these, 624 of them belonged to Gen Z - the youngest labor force in any current job market.
Internship is the form of training most preferred by this particular group (48.5 percent), followed by student clubs (40.75 percent) and part-time jobs (34.7 percent).
The survey also revealed an interesting paradox across all age groups: while their first priority when it comes to choosing jobs was salary and financial benefits, 51.3 percent quit a job if opportunities and room for personal development were lacking.
Other reasons were better job offers at 32.4 percent and poor relationship with line managers (10.8 percent).
The results dovetail with another survey by Talentnet and Mercer which found 47 percent of Vietnamese employees leave their job due to lack of clear career paths and opportunity and 29 percent do the same if relationships with peers or supervisors go poorly.
At some point, some SMEs have to borrow up to 60 percent of their requirement from loan sharks, Nguyen Kim Hung, general director of Verco Company, said at the Capital-Financial Forum held in Hanoi in August.
According to a VCCI survey of 504 businesses access to credit done at the end of 2017, 60 percent of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) did not have access to loans from the formal sector.
The survey was done as part of a project called Supporting Vietnamese Enterprises to Improve Access to Credit, Improving Governance and Financial Transparency.
Many rigid government policies too act as barriers.
Banks favor large loans to large companies because of lower risk.
While loans against mortgage remain commonplace, SMEs find it difficult to meet this requirement since they do not have collateral or the value of their collateral is too low.
According to the VCCI survey, over 80 percent of SMEs have capital of less than VND2 billion ($87,000).
At the end of each year, ahead of the big shopping season, businesses scramble for funds, but find it difficult to get loans from the banks.
The difficulties faced by SMEs in accessing credit have been discussed for many years.
There are many causes.
Lack of management competence and financial transparency are two common weaknesses of SMEs, and as a result they are unable to acquire banks trust and get funding for risky projects without collateral.
As for credit institutions, besides the difficulty in verifying the cash flows of certain projects, they must also weigh the risks involved, and so still prioritize collateral.
So SMEs and credit institutions are not on the same page.
In business, it is very important to recognize and set a level of tolerable risk.
Vietnamese banks main source of income remains lending to corporate customers.
When smaller businesses have difficulty accessing credit due to collateral-related issues, banks recalibration of their risk norms to reflect the businesses difficulties will help them lend more successfully.
Only when credit institutions change their risk norms will they be able to resolve the difficulties related to collateral faced by SMEs. And only when trust is established can unsecured loans increase.
Credit institutions should diversify their credit products and enlarge their range of lending practices to match the various funding needs of SMEs. If a business cannot acquire others trust, it is very difficult for them to raise funds, including in the form of loans from banks.
Unsecured loans depend on trust in and the reputation of a borrower.
Therefore, SMEs and family businesses requiring credit must build trust and credibility with the bank.
This means transparency of information and financial activities, enabling banks to clearly identify cash flows.
Businesses must also have a clear plan to repay principal and interest in time, which is another factor in building trust and confidence.
Cross-channel ferry companies have warned of gridlock around British ports, as they confirm they will not allow trucks to board ferries bound for France after a no-deal Brexit, unless they have the right paperwork.
We cannot take lorries across that cannot enter the country, one ferry company told BBC Newsnight.
Many UK exporters are yet to obtain the proper documentation.
The Department for Transport said plans were in place to manage disruption.
Newsnight has spoken to sources at the main freight ferry companies operating in the channel.
'A bundle of trucks with nowhere to go' If a truck doesn't have the right document we cannot board him.
We cannot take lorries across that cannot enter the country, said Gert Jakobson, a spokesman for DFDS, which transports 1.2 million trucks between Dover and Calais and Dunkirk each year.
That was corroborated by a source at a different ferry company, which did not want to comment publicly.
There's no point in boarding vehicles, because at the other end our French colleagues have told us we won't be allowed to proceed, the source said.
Both companies said the result of this procedure, given many trucks are expected to turn up without the right documentation, was likely to be tailbacks of trucks on the UK side of the channel.
For a period of time, for a few weeks and months, we assume the problems will be bigger.
There will be more who are not yet accustomed to the paperwork.
There will be a learning curve and then we believe it will work much better, said Mr Jakobsen.
If you have a constant stream of lorries that don't have the right documentation and it may take anything from 24-48 hours to get that documentation, potentially you've got a whole bundle of trucks and nowhere for them to go, said the other source.
Jean Marc Puissessau, the president and chief executive of Port Boulogne Calais, also told Newsnight that the French side expects ferry companies to deny boarding in the UK to trucks without the right paperwork.
If hauliers don't have documents they won't be allowed to board.
This was the rule on 29 March.
Those same rules will apply on 31 October, he said.
A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: There are well-developed plans in place to manage any traffic disruption in Kent in the event of a no deal scenario, keeping the M20 open with traffic continuing to flow in both directions.
The government remains focused on ensuring the UK's smooth and orderly withdrawal from the EU.
Both French and UK port officials have previously sought to downplay concerns about traffic chaos in the wake of a no-deal Brexit.
In June, the Dover Harbour Board CEO Doug Bannister said the Port of Dover, as with our sister ports in France and our ferry partners, are prepared for the 31st of October.
And his Calais counterpart Mr Puissesseau, had pointed to the construction of new customs facilities and vehicle holding pens at the French port, saying there will be no delay on the French side.
But research by Imperial College London, commissioned by the BBC , suggested just two minutes of extra check times at UK borders could result in queues extending up to 30 miles from Dover into Kent.
And Newsnight revealed that as of June 2019, two thirds of the relevant UK firms had still not applied for an Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) number, which they would need to trade with the EU after a no-deal Brexit.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Philip Hammond raised concerns that France could effectively push problems to the UK side of the channel.
Many of the levers are held by others — the EU 27 or private business.
We can seek to persuade them but we can't control it.
For example, we can make sure that goods flow inwards through the port of Dover without any friction but we can't control the outward flow into the port of Calais, the chancellor told Panorama .
Each day, around 10,000 lorries pass through the port of Dover, which handles 17% of the UK's goods trade, worth more than £120bn.

Workers whose jobs might become obsolete as a result of automation are to receive help in retraining from a new national government scheme.
Up to 20 million manufacturing jobs around the world could be replaced by robots by 2030, according to analysis firm Oxford Economics.
The scheme will support workers by helping them find a new career or gain more skills, should their jobs change.
The programme will be trialled initially in Liverpool.
Technologies like AI and automation are transforming the way we live and work and bringing huge benefits to our economy, said Education Secretary Damian Hinds.
But it also means that jobs are evolving and some roles will soon become a thing of the past.
The National Retraining Scheme will be pivotal in helping adults across the country, whose jobs are at risk of changing, to gain new skills and get on the path to a new, more rewarding career.
This is a big and complex challenge, which is why we are starting small, learning as we go, and releasing each part of the scheme only when it's ready to benefit its users.
According to Oxford Economics, people whose jobs become obsolete because of industrial robots and computer programs are likely to find that comparable roles in the services sector have also been squeezed by automation.
On average, each additional robot installed in lower-skilled regions could lead to nearly twice as many job losses as those in higher-skilled regions of the same country, exacerbating economic inequality and political polarisation, which is growing already, the analysis firm found.
Prof Alan Woodward, a computer expert from the University of Surrey says that although automation will lead to the loss of some jobs, this is inevitable, because it is now far cheaper to manufacture products in other countries.
Automation is not here to put people out of work, it's here to free them up, he told the BBC.
We're better off using people's brains, not their hands - things that machines can't do.
That's what we should be heading towards.
TechUK, the body representing the UK tech industry said it welcomed the government's move.
It is right that the government is starting small to ensure lessons are learnt, and adaptations are made along the way, but the ambition to scale so that this becomes a truly national retraining scheme cannot be lost, techUK's head of policy, Vinous Ali, told the BBC.
Whilst the focus is on job displacement, the fact is no job is likely to remain untouched by the fourth Industrial Revolution, so we will all need to learn new skills.
This means we need to be making significant investments in lifelong learning and helping people to navigate a pathway through this change.
Sir Jony Ive has designed some of Apple's most iconic products over the years and was a key influence on the firm's simplistic design.
The 52-year-old has spent the better part of his adult life at Apple and was close to its co-founder, Steve Jobs.
The departure of the thoughtful Sir Jonathan for his own company will be a loss for Apple, which is already facing challenges.
From the ground-breaking iMac to Apple's ambitious new Apple Park campus, he has helped to shape one of the world's most successful companies.
Jony is a singular figure in the design world and his role in Apple's revival cannot be overstated, said Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive.
Sir Jonathan grew up in Chingford, Essex, born to a silversmith and a schools inspector.
He studied design at Newcastle Polytechnic - now Northumbria University - and it is there he designed his first phone, which looked like a gadget from a sci-fi movie.
After graduating, he worked at a London-based design consultancy that had Apple among its clients.
He began working at Apple in 1992.
He went on to became head of the company's design team at a time when Apple was in poor financial health and cutting jobs.
His design of the iMac in 1998 and the iPod in 2001 helped to trigger a dramatic turnaround in the firm's fortunes.
Other landmark designs that followed included the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010.
From the coloured iMacs and the different generations of Apple products; the computer line, the laptop line, the iPhone and every generation of iPhone since then, the iPad generations, the transformers, the chargers, the connectors - all of those things came out of Jony's team, says Tim Kobe, the chief executive of Eight Inc and the designer of the first four generations of Apple retail stores.
More recently, Sir Jonathan has been responsible for Apple Park, the company's new 175-acre campus in California.
The campus, which opened in 2017 , features a 2.8 million-sq-ft main building with the world's largest panels of curved glass.
The cult of Jony Ive Sir Jonathan has achieved something akin to cult folk hero status with the general public - in particular Apple fans, but why?
There is a fascination with Jony Ive because he is a mysterious figure who tends to shun publicity but when he talks, he sums up Apple's values, says Macworld UK editor David Price.
Since the death of Steve Jobs, the technology pioneer and co-founder of Apple who died in 2011, Apple fans have looked to Sir Jonathan even more, Mr Price adds, because he has more charisma than Apple's chief executive Tim Cook.
Videos of Sir Jonathan frequently go viral online.
He is charismatic but he's also shy.
People really like the fact he doesn't push himself forward, he's thoughtful and reserved.
He always credited his team.
Mr Price remembers an appearance Sir Jonathan made on the BBC children's TV show Blue Peter in 2013.
On Blue Peter he was judging designs by children and he put a lot of thought into their work and gave them really good feedback.
Creating desirability According to Mr Price, the late Steve Jobs understood that design was absolutely key to the success of products, and so he made Apple's chief designer a member of the management suite of executives.
Over time, Sir Jonathan would eventually oversee both the software and hardware design for all Apple products.
Not all of these products have been a success - there have been missteps, like the Magic Mouse 2, which had a charging port on the bottom, so it couldn't be used while it was charging.
However, on the whole Sir Jonathan is considered to be responsible for much of Apple's success and popularity with consumers.
He gave Apple desirability.
He stripped away layers of clunky technological design and he created these incredibly smooth shiny objects with rounded edges and fewer buttons, says the Design Museum's chief curator, Justin McGuirk.
He applied the tradition of German modernism from the mid-20th Century, which upheld the philosophy that less design was better.
The more you can reduce something, the more beautiful and functional it is.
He created this ideal of a tech product, which was easy to use, beautiful and uncluttered.
The Design Museum awarded Sir Jonathan its inaugural Designer of the Year award in 2003, because he was already becoming something of a household name.
People usually can't name designers in the tech world - they can rarely name designers at all, unless they're fashion designers, said Mr McGuirk.
Undeniably, over the last 20 years, if you look at how any laptop or smartphone is designed, companies are finding it hard to distinguish themselves from an aesthetic Apple designed.
They're following - not leading.
Sir Jonathan has spoken about the importance of simplicity during several press interviews over the years.
As a designer, what I think you are trying to do is solve extremely complex problems but make that resolution very simple.
You're not dragging people through the victories - or otherwise - that you've been working on, Sir Jonathan said in an interview with the Financial Times .
I'm really proud of all of those victories that are unseen.
With Sir Jonathan departing Apple to start his own firm, there are concerns that Apple products won't be the same any more.
Apple were terrified of losing him, says Mr Price.
There will be an amazing set of designers left behind - that's the team he put together - but people are going to start to worry.
I don't think it can be business as usual.
He's going to taper off the work he does for Apple, whether it's fairly soon or takes a few years.
Only one in four people would consider buying a fully electric car in the next five years.
That is the finding of one of the most comprehensive studies into UK consumers and pure electric vehicles.
There has been a renewed focus on the climate and environment recently.
The reluctance of British drivers to embrace cleaner electric technology could be seen as a concern for those who want to move towards a low carbon future at a faster pace.
Range factor As part of the research, British motorists were asked to drive three cars for four days apiece.
They were: An electric VW e-Golf hatchback A plug-in hybrid VW Golf GTE hatchback A standard internal combustion engine VW Golf hatchback GT Edition It was all part of a study conducted by the Transport Research Laboratory, which is owned by a not-for-profit foundation overseen by firms in the transport industry.
'Why I didn't buy electric' Dad of two Jon Cook recently bought a new petrol SUV.
After researching the market, he didn't feel an electric car was right for long family trips to Cornwall and there were no local electric charging points.
There is definitely an increased cost in buying electric, he said.
And also just where you go to charge the cars.
We live on a street so it would be quite difficult to have a charger on our street.
Sales of pure electric cars rose to 1,517 in April 2019, an increase of 588 on the same month last year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
They accounted for 0.9% of total sales for the month.
The distance the electric car could travel between charges, known as the range, was one of the most limiting factors for the consumers who took part.
Analysis revealed that a range of 320 km (200 miles) was needed for 50% of participants to consider owning a fully electric car.
Increasing the range to 480 km (300 miles) meant 90% would consider electric.
Around half of the participants indicated they were likely to choose a plug-in hybrid as a main or second household car in the next five years.
The same quantity would consider a fully electric car as a second vehicle.
'Purchase cost' Dr George Beard from the Transport Research Laboratory analysed the data.
Key barriers to adoption of electric vehicles include the electric range, he said.
The range needs to be long enough to give consumers confidence that the vehicle can meet their needs.
The upfront purchase cost, and the availability of charging infrastructure so they can charge where and when they need, were also factors.
The government is legally bound to reduce CO2 emissions in 2050 by 80% compared with levels in 1990, and reducing vehicle emissions is seen as a critical part of this.
As part of its clean air strategy, the government has pledged to end the sale of all new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2040.
'More competition' Last year, motoring groups condemned the government's decision to cut subsidies for buying greener cars, as grants for new plug-in hybrids were scrapped, and discounts on all-electric cars were cut from £4,500 to £3,500.
Cash incentives have been offered since 2011 to help promote cleaner cars and meet emissions targets.
Last month, sales of plug-in hybrids in the UK fell by 1,000 on the same month last year, to just under 2,000 cars.
The government denies that reducing its subsidy for electric cars last year has had a detrimental effect.
But the price of the car was considered very important or extremely important by more than 85% of participants, in relation to both fully electric and plug-in hybrid.
Consistent with this, 73% of participants reported being fairly likely or very likely to have a plug-in hybrid in the household in the next five years if government grants were available to reduce purchase costs.
Roads Minister Jessie Norman said: We're getting lots of electric cars coming onto the market and there's more competition and that is starting to bring prices down.
As that happens it's better to spread the money over a wider group and encourage take-up that way and that's what we've done.
Household water bills in England and Wales will fall by between £15 and £25 a year from 2020 to 2025, the regulator Ofwat has pledged.
A forthcoming price review will give water companies less wiggle room to recover the costs of debt and equity from customers, the regulator said.
Ofwat was criticised by an influential government committee in 2016 for overestimating water firms' costs.
Water UK, said it was a tough challenge from Ofwat.
Consumers can look forward to a real terms fall in water bills, Ofwat said.
Since privatisation in 1989, water bills have risen above inflation by about 40%, leading to a debate about whether privatisation works for that industry.
The regulator's chief executive, Cathryn Ross, told the BBC: We have an early view on the financing costs that we're going to enable companies to recover from their customers.
That's the biggest single driver of the bill.
Financing costs are about a third of the average bill.
She said those financing costs for water companies had come down from 3.74% in 2014 to 2.4% now, and that difference can be passed on to customers.
But companies are allowed to add the cost of inflation on to bills.
So from 2020, customers will be paying less than they would have been paying had the price controls not been set at that level by Ofwat, but there may not be an actual, noticeable fall in the bill.
Michael Roberts, Chief Executive of Water UK, said Ofwat's review would be tougher for some companies than others.
However, he added: The industry has a strong track record in providing customers with a world class product and service.
We've cut bills, increased help for the less well-off, and reduced leakage by a third, and we are committed to achieving even more for customers in the future.
The final Ofwat price review will be published in 2019.
Analysis: BBC Today programme business presenter Dominic O'Connell Jeremy Corbyn has a simple remedy for the perceived excessive profits and underperformance of water companies - nationalisation.
Ofwat's answer is not so easily digestible - 260 pages of dense regulatorese, full of catchy concepts like the weighted average cost of capital for appointee companies.
The headline savings promised, just £15 to £25 a year from an average bill in the five years from 2020, will also not set many hearts racing.
Ofwat's problem is that the companies it regulates have by and large prospered despite its successive attempts to crack down on returns.
Severn Trent, the largest quoted water company - one that has shares listed on the stock exchange - has promised its shareholders dividends of inflation plus 4% for the foreseeable future, an astonishing return for what is a low-risk utility stock.
Ofwat needs to find a much sharper tool if its solution, rather than Mr Corbyn's, is to catch the public imagination.
Ms Ross said nationalisation would be a political decision, but that since privatisation, water firms had invested £140bn.
There has to be a question about whether government would do that if that were to land on the public balance sheet, but of course, government can borrow more cheaply, she said.
In a price review, Ofwat looks at the costs of financing that water firms face; the costs of service, such as how much it costs to transport water or treat it; and it looks at how water firms can improve their service.
In 2016, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said Ofwat had consistently overestimated water companies' costs.
Ms Ross said the regulator had taken a view in 2009 of what the financing costs would be, and actually the financing costs were a lot lower than that, and that's really why the MPs were criticising us.
We've taken that on board, and that's why today...
we're taking a tougher line, she added.
'Claw back' The Consumer Council for Water, a watchdog, said an Ofwat decision to get rid of a cap on rewards for beating performance targets could open the door to bill instability after 2019.
Tony Smith, the watchdog's chief executive, said: This could hand companies an opportunity to claw back some of the money they would be unable to get through lower financing costs and it could lead to bill increases which many customers view as rewards for doing the day job.
The world has entered the Fourth Industrial Revolution and in Vietnam, this is evidence in the digitization trend that has emerged in almost all fields, including trade, payments traffic management, education and healthcare.
Many Vietnamese businesses are engaging in e-commerce, applying payment platforms using QR Code technology, e-wallet, social networking, IoT devices, and so on.
These trends and other issues were highlighted at a forum on Strengthening the capacity of Vietnamese enterprises to participate in the digital economy market recently organized by Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) and Facebook Vietnam.
Pham Hoang Tien, director of Small and Medium Enterprise Support Center (VCCI), said that the social network allows businesses to reach new markets and customers, giving them the chance to build a strong and sustainable business.
Tien said he highly appreciates Facebooks Community Boost Program for SMEs in Vietnam, which provides a valuable space for Vietnamese businesses to learn real business skills.
A new study by Morning Consult, commissioned by Facebook for small and medium enterprises in six countries – Australia, India, Indonesia, South Korea, the Philippines and Vietnam – shows that 85 percents of SMEs have confirmed that Facebook helps attract customers and 74 percent of small and medium businesses have increased sales through the worldwide social network.
In Vietnams retail market, e-commerce only accounts for 3.6 percent of sales, a modest figure compared to the Asia Pacific average of 14.5 percent, the forum heard.
Amidst the technological boom that drives business competition, social networking is the most effective advertising channel, speakers said.
Christy Le, director of Facebook Vietnam, said Facebook's goal was to equip SMEs with digital skills to seize business opportunities and grow.
We want to inspire more business owners to take the big leap forward and help millions of other business owners narrow the gap, get closer to untapped opportunities, push the economy to grow strongly, she said.
This is the second time the Small and Medium Enterprise Support Center has implemented the Community Boost Program in Vietnam.
In addition, Facebook is also working closely with local organizations, SMEs and startups to advise them on how to seize the opportunity to enhance their competitiveness in the digital economy.
Following the launch of the Community Boost Program and the Women Entrepreneurs program, 5,157 small business owners in 27 provinces across the country have been trained by professionals to gain access to technology, the forum heard.
The awards are instituted by the Dot Property Group, a digital media company that owns and operates 10 property portal websites and complimentary offline media throughout Southeast Asia.
They compare developers, projects and real estate agents in region against certain set criteria.
Vietnam dominated the 2018 edition by winning 12 awards, followed by Thailand with 11.
Other award winners were from Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines.
Winners at this years award ceremony.
More than 25 awards were named this year.
The Vietnamese winners collected their awards at a special media ceremony held at the InterContinental Saigon in Ho Chi Minh City.
CityLand continued to impress with their upscale developments and the companys efforts were rewarded with the Best Luxury Developer Southeast Asia Award this year.
IRB Investment JSC was the biggest individual winner, scoring three awards including Best Innovative Developer Southeast Asia.
The special media ceremony held at the InterContinental Saigon in Ho Chi Minh City.
Award organizers said the work of real estate agents was being acknowledged on the regional stage for the first time ever at the Dot Property Southeast Asia Awards with the introduction of the Best Real Estate Agencies Southeast Asia category.
Eight of the regions leading agencies were honoured, with Thu Thiem Real Estate representing Vietnam.
Were excited to be announced the Dot Property Southeast Asia Awards 2018 winners.
They come from Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia, said Matthew Campbell, CEO of Dot Property.
We take a different approach to selecting winners.
Developers, projects and agencies are not pitted against one another, but measured against set criteria.
This means winners are ultimately selected on their ability to meet and exceed each criteria, he said.
Many business leaders representing developers, projects and agencies join the event.

Vietnam is one of the key markets Greek businesses are focused on.
Greece has ratified the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA), supports the early adoption of the deal, and wants to be a gateway to the EU for Vietnam.
Once the EVFTA comes into effect, the two countries expect their trade to surpass $300 million.
At a recent business forum, Doan Duy Khuong, vice president of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), said Greece is a country with developed shipping and tourism industries.
Shipping is an area for Vietnamese enterprises to cooperate and invest in.
Vietnam and Greece have held exchanges and explored cooperation in shipping.
The two countries are negotiating an agreement in shipping, he added.
Fostering cooperation in this area will not only benefit Vietnam's economy but also help implement its maritime strategy.
Khuong said the Greek economy has seen positive changes, gradually recovering and regaining momentum.
The EVFTA, expected to come into force next year, would certainly bolster bilateral trade and investment ties.
Konstantinos Bitsios, vice president of the Federation of Greek Enterprises, said Vietnams exports of agricultural products, textiles, and leather and footwear are highly competitive compared to that of China and India.
Vietnam is taking the initiative in renovating the economy, improving the business environment and improving the legal system to attract foreign investment.
Businesses in Greece are big corporations, experienced and with high technology in many fields.
But both countries need more information and an operational framework to expand strategic investment opportunities.
Last year bilateral trade topped $300 million.
The two countries have demand for and potential for development in shipping and logistics, shipbuilding, ports, tourism, and agricultural processing.
Shipping and tourism have been two key areas of bilateral cooperation in the last few years since Greece is a world leader in shipping with more than 4,500 commercial vessels or 20 percent of the worlds total.
Shares in Asos have sunk after the online fashion giant said that this year's profits are likely to be much lower than expectations.
The retailer said sales growth in the US and Europe had been held back by problems at its warehouses.
These problems meant that the range of clothes available to shoppers in these markets had been limited.
As a result, it now expects to report profits of £30m-£35m this year, well below the £55m forecast by analysts.
Asos chief executive Nick Beighton said overhauling its US and European warehouses had taken longer than anticipated, affecting its stock availability, sales and cost base in these regions.
He added that the company was clear on what was causing the problems and was making progress on resolving them.
However, Asos said that while the warehouse problems were short-term in nature, it added it might take some time to regain customers who had been affected.
Total sales across the group rose by 12% in the four months to 30 June, Asos said, and in the UK - where trading remained robust - sales grew by 16%.
However, the operational challenges at its warehouses in Berlin and Atlanta had caused problems in the US and Europe, where sales were up 12% and 5% respectively.
'Risk of losing out' Asos has enjoyed rapid growth in recent years as it has benefited from the shift towards shopping online.
However, last December it surprised investors with a shock profit warning, and the company's share price has now more than halved over the past year.
Shares in Asos opened down 20% on Thursday following the latest warning, before recovering some ground to stand 12% lower.
Analysts at Liberum said the latest warning suggested that serious questions needed answering.
The operational issues in Europe and the US signal to us a lack of enough senior leaders in the business with the adequate skill-set in the business to undertake the complex capital projects ongoing, they said.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: Fashion fans have plenty of places from which to buy clothes and so Asos is at risk of losing out to the competition if it cannot fix its problems fast.
We live in an impatient world where so many people want something in an instant.
If Asos doesn't have the stock ready to ship then consumers will simply go elsewhere.
However, Sofie Willmott, an analyst at research firm GlobalData, was more upbeat, arguing that the changes being made to US and EU distribution centres are vital to facilitate long-term growth in these key markets.
She added that the future remains bright for Asos.
The retailer's agility and willingness to change to remain relevant to its customer base will help it to continue gaining market share, both at home and abroad.''
Environment Secretary Michael Gove has warned water companies he is ready to give their regulator new powers if they cannot address public concerns over prices, leaks, executive pay and payments to shareholders.
Mr Gove has written to Ofwat, the water regulator, asking it to investigate each of the areas.
He told the BBC that he was ready to give Ofwat new powers.
Mr Gove said concerns were not a chimaera and would be taken seriously.
The privatised water companies have come under attack in recent years after studies revealed they had increased their levels of debt and paid out big dividends to shareholders.
Water bills set to fall from 2020 Bank left Thames Water with £2bn debt Thames Water fined £8.5m for leaks A study by the University of Greenwich found the companies had earned about £18bn in pre-tax profits over the past decade, and paid out about the same amount in shareholders.
Water prices have outstripped inflation by 36% since privatisation, Ofwat figures show.
Sir Ian Byatt, the first chief executive of Ofwat, said if he were still in the job he would insist on an immediate 10% cut in prices.
He said the regulator also needed to bring in a form of dividend cap, where if payouts to shareholders became too great, prices would be cut accordingly.
That would ensure the benefits of privatisation were shared with customers, not just financiers, he said.
At the same time there has been concern over action on leakages and pollution, particularly at Thames Water, which serves one-quarter of the population.
It has been handed a heavy fine for polluting the Thames, and been criticised for issuing nearly £2bn worth of dividends in the past decade, the payment of little corporation tax and the use of subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands, a tax haven.
Thames Water has recently cancelled its dividend and said it would scrap the Caymans' companies.
Steve Robertson, the chief executive, said criticism of the payments overlooked the industry's strong record of investment, with, he claimed had resulted in £10 of investment in infrastructure for every £1 paid to shareholders.
The debate around nationalisation is getting bogged down in dogma, ideology, and not focussing on outcomes, he said.
What does Ofwat want?
Mr Gove's promise of more powers for the regulator relies on Ofwat asking for them.
Rachel Fletcher, Ofwat's chief executive, said a dividend cap was not in its current thinking, nor direct action on executive pay or tax structures.
Instead, she said, Ofwat would require water companies to provide more public information on each of the areas of concern.
You can download the podcast of Dominic's full report on the Today programme here .
Thames Water's chief executive, Steve Robertson, will try to convince a group of hostile MPs on Tuesday that the company is sincere about its latest major repair programme - the one to its own reputation.
The company has become a regular target for regulators, customer service groups and politicians who variously complain it misses its leakage targets, provides poor services, pays its executives way too much and the taxman way too little.
Thames has been the poster boy for an industry that many feel has failed on the promised benefits of privatisation, such as efficiency, and has delivered only to shareholders and executives.
Between 2006 and 2015, Thames Water paid out £1.1bn in dividends.
In the same period, it paid £0 in corporation tax as it offset interest payments on billions in borrowings against profits.
The Thames Water plan to repair this relationship with society is a radical one.
Steve Robertson has already given up a £3m bonus and future payouts will be related to hitting leakage targets and customer satisfaction, rather than financial returns.
Radical change That is worth repeating as it is very unusual for a private company.
His pay will not be related to profits - 50% will be linked to hitting leak targets, with the other 50% linked to customer satisfaction scores and securing a favourable investment and pricing deal with the regulator.
Make no mistake - he could still end up getting paid more than £3m for a year's work for running a regional monopoly, but his competence will not be measured by how much profit he can squeeze out of a system built by the Victorians.
Radical change, too, for the shareholders, who will receive no dividends for the next two years.
No wonder the shareholder register has changed.
The Australian infrastructure investment bank Macquarie - nicknamed the vampire kangaroo - has been replaced by long-term pension fund investors such as the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and the Universities Superannuation Scheme.
The Thames Water experiment will be closely watched.
Public trust in business has been leaking away steadily, with failures such as BHS and Carillion turning it into a torrent.
The severing of the link between pay and financial performance may be a radical step for a private company - but not as radical as renationalisation.
ACFC, distributor of IPP Group, a major Vietnamese fashion retailer, has confirmed that they are introducing the OVS brand in Vietnam.
OVS is a popular fashion brand in Europe.
In Italy, the brand has 15 percent of the market share in the country's children aged 0-14 segment.
The companys products range is geared towards consumers of all ages.
Its collection stretches from bold, urban looks, to elegant, formal office attire.
At the same time, the OVS price tag targets the mass consumer segment.
An increasing middle-class population has made Vietnam a magnet for international fast fashion brands, industry insiders have noted.
The middle and affluent class, categorized as those earning $714 a month or more, would double to 33 million, about a third of the population, between 2014 and 2020, the Nikkei Asian Review reported recently, citing a study by the Boston Consulting Group.
Market research firm Nielsen estimates the number of middle and affluent class Vietnamese will reach 44 million by 2020 and 95 million by 2030.
By late 2017, there were some 200 international fashion brands, including Zara, H&M, Stradivarius, Pull & Bear and Massimo Dutti, in Vietnam, accounting for more than 60 percent of the market share.
A survey released in October last year by market research firm Q&Me showed fashion items topping online purchases in Vietnam, followed by IT products, cosmetics, food and beverage, and books and stationery.
According to Statista, a database portal of statistics, consumer survey results and industry studies, the apparel market will be worth $2.74 billion this year and is set to grow at 7.7 percent annually until 2021.
Vietnams largest oil refinery begins commercial operations By Le Hoang &nbspDecember 24, 2018 | 11:33 am GMT+7 Nghi Son has started commercial operations this Sunday.
Photo acquired by VnExpress The Nghi Son Refinery began commercial operation Sunday, and is expected to meet about 40 percent of domestic petroleum demand in 2019.
Speaking at its inauguration, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc emphasized the key role of the project.
The refinery will process 200,000 barrels of crude per day in the first phase, equivalent to 10 million tons a year, double the capacity of Dung Quat, Vietnams only other refinery, in the central Quang Ngai Province.
Situated in the Nghi Son Economic Zone, 200 km south of Hanoi in the central province of Thanh Hoa, Nghi Son is expected to hit 80 percent of capacity next year.
According to the Thanh Hoa People's Committee, last June the refinery was already capable of 10 refined petroleum products such as liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline A92, A95, diesel oil, and kerosene.
As of December the plant has processed around five million tons of crude.
Nghi Son together with Dung Quat is expected to meet 80-90 percent of domestic petroleum demand, reducing Vietnams dependence on imports.
The $9 billion refinery is 35.1 percent owned by Japans Idemitsu Kosan Co, 35.1 percent by Kuwait Petroleum, 25.1 percent by state-run PetroVietnam and 4.7 percent by Mitsui Chemicals Inc.
Mercedes-Benz Vietnam to recall 4,802 SUVs over faulty seatbelts By Thanh Nhan &nbspDecember 24, 2018 | 04:54 pm GMT+7 The Mercedes-Benz logo is seen before the company's annual news conference in Germany.
Photo by Reuters/Michaela Rehle Mercedes-Benz Vietnam is expected to issue a recall notice for 4,802 vehicles due to seatbelt faults in their rear seats.
Company representatives said that an application for the recall has been submitted and they are waiting for approval from the Vietnam Register, the vehicle registration, inspection and quality control department of the Ministry of Transport.
The models affected by this recall are the popular GLC 200, GLC 250 4MATIC, and GLC 300 4MATIC.
These models were assembled at the Mercedes factory in HCMC between March 2016 and February 2018, and sold mainly to Vietnamese consumers.
It is expected that owners of the faulty SUVs can have their vehicles checked and repaired free of charge at Mercedes Vietnam dealers nationwide from Jan 15, 2019 till the end of 2023.
For the left and right rear seats, the seatbelt retracts so much that its locking clip can be stuck in a crevice in the inner car plating.
If this happens, the clip cannot be retrieved and used again.
Mercedes GLC is one of the models distributed in the Vietnamese market by the German luxury manufacturer.
In 2017, GLC was the best-selling model for the company as well as the entire luxury car market, priced at VND1.68-2.9 billion ($72,032 – $124,032).
According to the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, FastGo is not yet eligible to be approved for a pilot phase, nor is it registered as a tech platform.
In a written reply to the Da Nang Department of Transports proposal to permit FastGo to operate, the Ministry of Transport has said that the application falls under the category of electronic contract service based - management support platform.
But, the ministry adds, it is yet to receive a proposal to launch the app directly from FastGo Vietnam JSC, which means the application is not yet ready to be approved for a pilot phase.
The ministry has also requested the Da Nang Department of Transport to inform cab companies not to use FastGo if the app is offered to them.
Furthermore, FastGo is not allowed to provide its services directly to taxi drivers, it says.
However, Nguyen Huu Tuat, FastGo CEO, is adamant that the app is not violating any law.
He told VnExpress that he has not received a written response the ministry or from the Da Nang Department of Transportation.
Tuat clarified that FastGo does not provide transport support management services to individual drivers in Da Nang.
It only services drivers of local transport cooperatives.
FastGo has filed the information and sent a request for approval for a pilot phase, but has not received a response from the Ministry of Transport, said Tuat.
He said Fastgo is neither defined as a transport service provider nor is it a transport cooperative.
It is merely an application connecting drivers with customers.
Tuat said that he was waiting for new transport regulations on this issue, following which the company will determine the specific business category for registering its app.
FastGo has been functioning in Vietnams major cities since June.
It is only after six months that regulators have backtracked and declared that its registration is incomplete.
A representative of the Department of E-Commerce and Digital Economy under the Ministry of Industry and Trade said: FastGo has not registered its tech platform with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
Therefore, it is unlawful for FastGo to engage with drivers or operate a transport management platform.
In response to this comment, Tuat asserted that he has submitted this proposal, but is yet to receive a reply.
Launched in June 2018, FastGo now operates in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang with more than 30,000 drivers.
At the end of August, the local company received funding from VinaCapital, and is planning to mobilize up to $50 million for a second expansion phase that will target Indonesia and Myanmar.
FastGo Vietnam Joint Stock Company was established in April 2018 with its headquarters in Hanoi.
The company belongs to a wide network of services provided by Nextech, a leading tech firm in Vietnam.
A Nikkei Asian Review report quoted the company as saying it hopes to make its service available in 20 cities in Vietnam and five other Southeast Asian markets, including the Philippines, Cambodia and Thailand, by the end of next year.
TikTok, a product of Bytedance, a Chinese software company headquartered in the U.S., offers a short video sharing application, 15 seconds per video for basic accounts.
Its initial content is primarily lip syncing, dancing, or recording with fancy stickers and other effects.
The TikTok app has quickly attracted the attention of many young people, particularly at school age, but is yet to appeal to older adults.
Diep Que Anh, national director of communications for TikTok Vietnam and other emerging markets, said that the application is trying to age its content to widen its user coverage.
It has to do this before it can become an advertising platform that can satisfy the demands of its client brands, some experts and industry insiders have said.
Not revealing specific numbers, Que Anh estimated that Vietnamese users spend an average of 28 minutes per day on TikTok.
Its prime time, when the app sees the highest traffic in the country, is 6 p.m.-8 p.m. every Friday and Saturday.
The platform is still in its ad-free phase.
There have been brands who have approached us regarding advertising, but we do not intend to monetize our service at the present time, Que Anh said, adding that they were waiting for the market to mature.
TikTok has opened its first support office in Ho Chi Minh City with around 70 employees.
Que Anh said this number will continue to grow to several hundred employees.
After just one year, Vietnam has become our fastest user growth market in Southeast Asia, she said.
According to Que Anh, TikTok now covers Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.
The Telegraph reported that in October, after receiving an additional $3 billion in capital from firms led by Softbank, KKR & Co and General Atlantic, Bytedance boosted its valuation to $75 billion, officially surpassing Uber to become the most valuable technology startup in the world.
The Telegraph and many other newspapers call Bytedance a Chinese tech firm, although Que Anh noted TikToks headquarters is in Los Angeles, the U.S., and that its products are already in 150 markets.
TikTok's strength in the global advertising market is growing rapidly.
According to Googles Best of 2018 list, TikTok is the only social networking application named in Users Choice Awards App of the year, while Facebook, Instagram or Youtube are no longer in the list.
Some reports estimate that the global audience for this app this year is about 500 million.
In Vietnam, the most successful content trend of the year - the 2018 AFF Cup, resulted in more than 120,000 videos released on the event, which attracted 54.8 million views.
No, no, no no, no no, was what Christine Lagarde was reported to have said when asked last year if she was interested in running the European Central Bank (ECB).
Yet just a few months later, she has been nominated as the institution's new president.
Ms Lagarde - known as the rock star of international finance - said the new role was an honour.
Poised, chic and known for her straight talking, she has become one of Europe's most influential ambassadors in the world of international finance.
Until this weekend, the main contenders for the ECB job were male central bankers.
But assuming the nomination is approved she will become the central bank's first ever female leader, responsible for the euro and the monetary policy of the eurozone.
First ever female is a tag that has followed Ms Lagarde throughout her career.
The former lawyer was the first woman to chair global law firm Baker McKenzie, the first woman to serve as a finance minister from any Group of Seven nation and then the first to lead the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Unsurprisingly she has long championed promoting women into powerful positions, saying it's the key to improving the world economy.
As I have said many times, if it had been Lehman Sisters rather than Lehman Brothers, the world might well look a lot different today, she said earlier this year.
The silver-haired 63-year-old is legendary for her stamina.
A former synchronised swimmer for the French national team, she is reported to exercise daily, even during meetings if necessary.
In her current role, she has been praised for steering the Washington-based IMF through the aftermath of the financial crisis.
'She will face challenges' Analysis by By Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent Christine Lagarde's status as rock star of international finance is beyond doubt.
She has a high profile as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, building on her experience as a cabinet minister in France.
What she doesn't have is the technical expertise as a central banker.
The previous presidents of the ECB did.
All three had been governors of their own national central banks.
Mario Draghi in particular presided over the bank at a time when it faced the eurozone financial crisis and a weak economic recovery.
The response was both innovative and technical.
Christine Lagarde would not be the first ever central banker to be in that position.
But there could well be challenges.
The eurozone is struggling with inflation that is persistently below its target.
Getting it back up might require more innovation.
Ms Lagarde would need to draw on the expertise of the ECB's technocrats.
Her career has however had one significant negative, when she was investigated for abuse of authority during her time as French finance minister in 2007.
In 2016, she was convicted in a French court for failing to challenge a €404m award to flamboyant French businessman Bernard Tapie in 2008 over the sale of sportswear brand Adidas.
She did not serve a sentence.
Ms Lagarde has always defended her decision, saying it was the best solution at the time.
Her drive means Ms Lagarde's career has continued unaffected.
It's a determination that she learnt at a young age after her father's death when she was 17.
Her mother, widowed at just 38, bought Ms Lagarde and her three younger brothers up alone.
My mother was a very strong character.
I learnt a lot from her, she told the Financial Times in an interview.
Consistently ranked among the top 10 most powerful women globally, Ms Lagarde has helped to rebuild the IMF's credibility following Greece's 2010 bailout, which bent the fund's rules.
She also presided over the IMF's biggest bailout, a $57bn deal for Argentina last year that many credited with arresting emerging market turbulence.
Ms Lagarde has admitted before that she lacks economic experience, telling the Guardian in 2012: I've studied a bit of economics, but I'm not a super-duper economist.
Many don't believe this will hold her back.
One former IMF official said her leadership of the fund meant she was exceptionally qualified to run the ECB.
She knew how to impose calm without posing as morally superior, instead displaying a touch of humanity, said a former colleague.
Mark Sobel, a former US Treasury official and chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, said Ms Lagarde has experience in monetary policy even though she is not an economist.
She's been involved in all the monetary debate and it's not like they don't discuss monetary policy at the fund, he said.
Christine Lagarde's career 1956: Born in Paris 1973: Wins scholarship to exclusive US school for a year, where she perfects her English 1981: After law school in Paris, joins international law firm Baker & McKenzie as an associate, becoming chair 18 years later 2005: Becomes France's trade minister in 2005 2007: Becomes France's finance minister, the first woman to hold this post not just in France but in any of the G8 major industrial countries 2011: Becomes head of the IMF 2019: Nominated to become president of the European Central Bank
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney gave Facebook's proposed digital currency Libra a cautious welcome in a major speech on Thursday.
He said it could substantially lower costs and increase financial inclusion, but needs regulation.
Mr Carney also announced that non-banks will be able to hold Bank of England accounts.
And he highlighted climate and sustainability concerns.
Mark Carney has given a swift and positive reaction to Facebook's plan, unveiled just last week, and one that will no doubt please Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of the Libra members.
However, while Mr Carney said he has an open mind, he is not offering an open door.
Unlike social media, where regulation is struggling to catch up after its mass adoption by billions of users, Mr Carney promised to make sure regulation to protect against risks including data privacy and money laundering is ready in advance.
Libra is intended to be a currency that can be transferred via social media with its value based on a basket of real life currencies rather than the so-called crypto currencies whose value is not linked to existing exchange rates.
Libra, said Mr Carney, could be systemically important - and will be regulated accordingly.
The Libra Association said it was committed to fostering a secure network with anti-money laundering and anti-fraud programmes.
It added that the association would not hold personal data.
This is a significant speech in many ways and may be looked back on as the time the fusty old bank of England really donned its digital trousers.
Bank of England accounts Less headline-grabbing than Facebook but arguably more important was the announcement that the Bank of England will allow non-banks to have an account with them.
All the commercial banks we as customers bank with have their own account at the Bank of England where they store their reserves.
Allowing non-banks - for example payment companies like Square and Worldpay - to have their own account could make payments faster, cheaper, more reliable and more available to people outside the traditional banking system.
When I asked Bank officials what the existing High Street banks thought of this - there were some wry smiles - one said I'm sure they will have a point of view and will want to express it.
The Bank will also lay some of the groundwork for an open platform for small business financing, Mr Carney said.
Climate concerns The governor said the most important future risk was that posed by climate change.
This is a favourite subject of his and the Bank of England will be among the first regulators in the world to include the cost of future climate change (floods, droughts, crop failures, property damage) when it assesses whether financial institutions are strong enough to survive a crisis.
Mark Carney has just over six months left in the job.
With this speech he laid out a way to future proof the financial system he has overseen for nearly a decade.
Sick leave and pay should be more flexible, so people with poor mental health can avoid severe financial hardship, a charity has said.
The Money and Mental Health Policy Institute said preventative, part-time sick leave would help those facing mental health difficulties.
Greater access to insurance products could protect the income of those with pre-existing conditions, it added.
Its report suggested mental health cost UK employers up to £42bn a year.
The research found that 2.3 million people in the UK were experiencing mental health problems that affected the amount of paid work they could do.
One of those was Sarah James, 58, who said she had had to take time off on three occasions, owing to periods of serious ill-health.
Stress left her in a manic state, and she said she had emerged with massive amounts of debt - on one occasion totalling £16,000.
This had left her struggling to afford food and pay bills.
She said it had been a challenge to get back to work, but her continuous service in local authority employment had allowed her to build up a sick-pay safety net, which had helped.
The institute said that tweaks to the benefits system, more flexible sick pay and phased returns to work would all help workers who found themselves in a similar situation as Mrs James.
Helen Undy, director of the institute, said: For thousands of people in the UK, sick days are a luxury they just can't afford.
Many with mental health problems are finding themselves too ill to work and too broke not to - choosing between causing harm to their mental health by working, or harm to their finances by taking time to recover.
It's a vicious cycle, ultimately forcing many out of the workplace entirely.
We want to see the government and employers taking urgent steps to improve sick pay, access to benefits and other income protection, so that a mental health diagnosis is not the first step out of the workforce.
Hidden issue The institute's report suggested sickness absence from the workplace due to mental health problems cost £8bn, with a further £1bn lost to the self-employed.
Mental health problems could lead to longer periods of sickness absence.
A survey of people who had taken time off work owing to a mental health problem found that 76% of them had taken more than a month off at least once.
Some 300,000 people with a long-term mental health condition lost their job each year, it added.
A survey of 44,000 people carried out by the mental health charity Mind found that only half of those who had experienced problems with stress, anxiety or low mood had talked to their employer about it.
A recent poll by the Institute of Directors found fewer than one in five firms offered mental health training for managers.
Poor relationships with line managers, along with workload, have the biggest negative impact on employees' mental health, the survey found - closely followed by poor relationships with colleagues.
The three brands that will spearhead the ecosystem effort are NovaHills, NovaBeach and NovaWorld.
The strategy is to focus on locations with great tourism potential, like Phu Quoc, Can Tho, Ho Chi Minh City, Ba Ria - Vung Tau, Phan Thiet - Binh Thuan, Ninh Thuan, Cam Ranh - Khanh Hoa, Quang Nam and Da Nang.
The group plans a whopping 2,300 units in these areas.
NovaTourism will focus on eight main areas.
Show villas at NovaBeach Cam Ranh.
The first is accommodation, which involves building hotels and resort complexes operated and managed by internationally well known companies.
The group will also create real estate products for investment (villas, condotels, second homes) with high liquidity and long-term profitability for customers.
The tourism service ecosystem will cooperate with other firms on developing passenger transport, other logistics operations, franchizing, launching culinary services, and operating modern shopping spaces.
The groups tourism focus will also see it get involved in the entertainment industry, building water parks, theme parks, aquariums, zoos, golf courses and integrated entertainment centers.
These will help attract and extend the stay of domestic and foreign tourists.
In addition, it will contribute to building a tourism brand for the locality.
The NovaHills brand will involve projects of less than 100ha in areas with hilly landscapes.
The first project launched under this brand is the NovaHills Mui Ne Resort & Villas (in Phan Thiet, Binh Thuan).
NovaBeach projects will also involve land areas of less than 100ha located in coastal areas.
The brands first project, the NovaBeach Cam Ranh Resort & Villas (Cam Ranh, Khanh Hoa), is preparing to debut.
The NovaWorld brand, meanwhile, will build entertainment complexes on areas of 100ha or more.
They will have resort villas, hotels, second-homes, commercial townhouses and so on, combining them with high-class entertainment facilities, including theme parks, wild zoos, golf courses, and so on.
Each cluster will follow a main theme, creating its own accents in selected localities like Ba Ria - Vung Tau and Phan Thiet - Binh Thuan.
It is expected that this year, the company will introduce a project in Phan Thiet (Binh Thuan) and another in Ba Ria - Vung Tau.
Novaland has started to build strategic partnerships with many leading brands in the world and in the country to deploy high quality tourism services.
It has signed a strategic cooperation pact with the Minor Hotels global corporation in managing and operating seven hotel - resort areas with a total of more than 3,500 rooms.
They has also signed a partnership with the Greg Norman Golf Course Design Company to develop four Greg Norman branded golf courses.
The group has assigned the Hoa Binh Group as the construction contractor for the project in Cam Ranh, Khanh Hoa and Ricons for the project in Phan Thiet, Binh Thuan.
Strategic partnership signing ceremony between Novaland and Hoa Binh Corp for the project in Cam Ranh, Khanh Hoa.
In addition, the group is working with the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) on Developing Mekong Delta Tourism to adapt to Climate Change.
In 2018, the Group put into operation the Azerai Can Tho resort and Anantara Mui Ne resort.
By the end of the year, it developed and delivered over 6,000 quality real estate products to customers.
Through a journey of more than a quarter century since its inception, Novaland has become one of the leading real estate developers in Vietnam with over 40 housing projects in HCMC alone.
Totally, it has more than 26,000 diverse products, serving about 250,000 customers.

Tran Ba Duong, chairman of the Truong Hai Auto Corporation (THACO), said at a conference last week that BMW cars will be the next vehicle that THACO assembles in the country, following other brands like Peugeot, Kia and Mazda.
He did not reveal further details about when this would happen and what models would be assembled.
THACO became the sole authorized distributor of BMW in Vietnam starting January this year, after Ho Chi Minh City-based Euro Auto lost its license for smuggling 133 BMW cars in December 2016.
Duong had said earlier that he plans to open 15 BMW and MINI (a car brand owned by BMW) showrooms by early next year.
However, the company currently runs only one BMW showroom in Hanoi, another in HCMC and one MINI showroom, also in HCMC.
THACO has not revealed its revenue from selling BMW cars this year, but a source told VnExpress that the company sold almost 400 vehicles in the first half of this year.
Euro Auto, at its peak, sold 1,400 BMW and 400 MINI cars a year.
BMW cars were first assembled in Vietnam in 1995 by the VMC company in Hanoi.
However, low sales led to the factorys shutdown in 2005, and VMC had to spend two years selling its inventory.
Mercedes-Benz is currently the only luxury car brand that assembles its vehicles in Vietnam, and it tops domestic market sales in this segment.
Industry insiders say that if BMW cars are assembled in the country again, they could emerge a strong competitor, especially in terms of price.
The Department of Payments at the State Bank of Vietnam reported a strong rise in payments over electronic channels between January and September, compared to the same period last year.
Accordingly, the value of online payments rose by 18.3 percent, while transactions over mobile apps and e-wallets rose by 126 percent and 161 percent respectively.
The number of transactions over Internet, mobile and e-wallet channels also rose 33 percent, 30 percent and 28 percent respectively.
Mobile payment is becoming a new trend with the rise of technologies such as QR codes, contact and contactless payments, and the tokenization of card information, said Nghiem Thanh Son, deputy director of the department.
The first months of 2018 saw the number of users and the value of transactions through electronic channels such as online, mobile and e-wallets rocket at many banks.
At Sacombank, statistics show that as of October, the number of registrations for online banking reached over 1.3 million accounts and for mobile banking 1.1 million accounts.
The total value of transactions per month through both channels exceeded VND108 trillion ($4.63 billion).
For VietinBank, the countrys second largest lender by assets, the number of internet banking users in the first half of this year surged 114 percent over the same period last year to a total of 1.5 million accounts and VND44.26 trillion ($1.90 billion) in total transaction value.
Its mobile banking users also reached 1.5 million, engaging in transactions totalling VND64.35 trillion ($2.76 billion) between January and June.
Over 7 million people are using digital services provided by MBBank.
The average transaction value per month reached VND27.4 trillion ($1.17 billion), with digital transactions making up approximately 2.6 million out of 3 million total monthly transactions seen at this bank.
Nguyen Hoang Minh, deputy director of the State Banks HCMC branch, noted that the number of online banking customers has seen average annual increase of 20 percent in recent years.
Minh said that in order to continue developing non-cash payment channels, credit institutions should pay attention to linking their cashless systems with the public sector, specifically in areas like health, education, payroll and utilities.
Cashless services should also expand to include online payment options for public services like buses, trains and other smart urban solutions, he said.
Twenty seven payment service providers had been licensed in Vietnam as of last March, with 20 of them offering digital wallets, according to the State Bank of Vietnam.
Others provide services such as financial switching, electronic clearing and payment gateway.
There are many reasons why banks, tech companies and fintech companies are venturing into the world of electronic wallets, including the growing global trends of digital banking and setting up financial startups.
Besides, Vietnam has a large population of young people who are compulsive smart phone users and fond of technology but lack interest in traditional banking services.
Consumers are increasingly living a modern lifestyle that is accompanied by digital services,” Tran Thanh Nam, founder and director of mobile payment player Moca Technology and Services Corporation, said.
“In addition to free social networks, they have begun to pay attention to incorporating electronic services for their daily needs.
From ride hailing to food delivery, it comes with safe and convenient non-cash payments.” Who are offering e-wallets?
Mocas popular rivals included MoMo, Bankplus, Vi Viet, VTC Pay, WePay, Mobivi, and Vimo.
As of December 2017 MoMo had more than five million users and expects to see a two- to three-fold increase this year.
Vi Viet has more than two million users and hopes to increase the number to 3.5 million this year.
Late last year Pham Tien Dung, head of the State Bank of Vietnams Payment Department, said only about five payment intermediaries earned profits.
The rest of the market has been labeled unstable.
Nguyen Dinh Thang, chairman of LienVietPostBank, which owns Vi Viet, said: E-wallets need more time to develop to meet customer needs and market potential, and using cash cannot be changed in the blink of an eye.
The market needs time to experience the utility and convenience of e-wallets.
Industry insiders said each e-wallet has its own development strategies and target customer segments.
But they admitted that the failure by many e-wallets to adapt to the financial ecosystem in Vietnam and the lack of widely accepted payment gateways are holding the industry back.
In 2017 MoMo garnered more customers by offering discounts and promotions and spending on advertising.
Then, this year it decided to exploit the power of the ecosystem by signing a deal with ride hailing company Uber Vietnam.
Unfortunately, Uber withdrew from Southeast Asia a few months later.
Zalo Pay was a latecomer but achieved great success at the beginning of this year by running a “lucky money” campaign during the Lunar New Year that enabled users to gift lucky money to their loved ones using the digital wallet.
This campaign was a huge hit also in China when WeChat and AliPay ran it.
Zalo has an advantage over other e-wallet rivals since it already has an enormous user database from its messaging application.
The competition is fierce The most recent tie-up, and one that could be a game changer, is between Moca and Grab.
The CEOs of both companies are ambitious about developing their electronic wallets.
Their strategy is “if we grow, we grow together”.
More specifically, the deal indicates that those who partner with Moca e-wallets will benefit from the large number of Grab population of millions of drivers and passengers across the country.
Grab users will soon be able to choose from all payment services offered by Moca, including bill payments, phone credit recharging, and non-cash payment at retail stores and fast food chains like 7-Eleven and McDonalds.
A combination of Momo popularity, rising Zalo Pay and the Moca-Grab marriage are exerting great pressure on dozens of other e-wallet providers.
Traditional mobile payment services of Vietnamese banks are also intimidated by the competitors.
Responding to this challenge, TPBank has updated the flight ticket support service on its mobile application.
UOB Bank Vietnam now allows in-app opening of new accounts in 10 minutes, reducing the time spent opening one at the bank by 80 percent.
In big cities like HCM City, four out of every five people have smart phones which can assist them in completing everyday tasks in a much faster and convenient way.
We always want to develop and leverage technology so that banking services are much simpler, safer and smarter for our customers from the very first transaction, said Harry Loh, CEO of UOB Vietnam.
This is the first time a Vietnamese firm has broken into this special group, positioned 84th.
Momo is also in the “Emerging 50” category, which includes newer companies that are at the forefront of innovative technologies and practices.
Its products help customers in Vietnam make nationwide cash transfers, pay more than 100 types of bills, recharge mobile phone accounts, settle personal loans, and purchase services like software licenses and online game cards, airline and movie tickets, etc.
The companys payment system partners with 24 domestic banks and foreign payment networks, including JCB, MasterCard, and Visa.
A judging panel comprised of senior partners from H2 Ventures and KPMG decided the final composition of the Fintech100 list.
H2 Ventures is a global thought leader in fintech venture capital investment while KPMG is a global network of independent member firms offering audit, tax and advisory services.
Companies were ranked based on total capital raised, rate of capital raising, location and degree of sub-industry disruption and the judging panel's subjective rating of the degree of product, service, customer experience, and business model innovation.
Other newcomers to the list include Argentina, Bahrain, Colombia, Czech Republic, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia, Myanmar, United Arab Emirates, and Thailand.
Leading the ranking this year are Chinas Ant Financial, the worlds largest third-party payments platform, JD Finance, a digital technology company and Singapores ride hailing firm Grab.
Answering a simple How are you?
with an honest detailed answer may lead to an awkward silence.
After all, it's often just longhand for hello.
But the government's official number-crunchers at the Office for National Statistics genuinely care about the response.
Next week, they'll publish their statistics into how people across the country are feeling about their lives.
Have they gone soft?
They've realised that how we've traditionally measured living standards or economic well-being isn't up to scratch.
We typically turn to GDP - gross domestic product.
That's the measure of how much companies, individuals and the government earn/spend/produce (in theory, each of those give the same answer), with an adjustment for exports less imports.
It measures the nation's net income, but may not tell the whole story.
First, there are things which can skew the big picture.
Take the first three months of this year, when the economy grew by 0.5%, according to the latest official figures.
At the time, many companies were busy stockpiling components and finished goods due to fears of a no-deal Brexit.
That makes growth look stronger, but that buzz of activity reflects contingency planning rather than a response to strong demand.
And it may mean less of that activity further down the line, making growth look weaker in subsequent quarters.
Winners and losers Even without distortions, GDP may not reflect the individual situation.
The fates of government businesses and households will differ hugely in any quarter.
The ONS provides a breakdown of some details.
It has recently delved deeper into households' situations with a well-being dashboard, which looks at things such as incomes, debt and anxiety levels (Spoiler alert: the most recent version shows most things on the rise).
And there'll be winners and losers across the country.
The Bank of England has also doubled down on work to highlight the fate of different regions.
But then there's what is left out by GDP: basically, anything unpaid, from volunteering to housework.
In other words, items that aren't termed market activity.
Economist Paul Samuelson joked that if a man marries his maid, GDP falls.
It's not so much a joke as a criticism (and not just of outdated gender stereotyping) that statisticians fail to value certain types of work.
The problem is that without payment, such work is hard to put a price tag on.
Holistic view Feeling a bit hard done-by aside, how much does that matter, given what policymakers actually use GDP for?
The Bank of England manages the economy by setting interest rates to influence spending and borrowing, while the government uses the figures to gauge how much tax might come in.
And of course, there's a multitude of other factors - from crime to gender equality, biodiversity, access to clean energy and education levels - that hit our current and future living standards.
These are just a few of the Sustainable Development Goals that the US has spelled out.
The ONS has embarked on a marathon task to identify and measure hundreds of indicators to reflect those.
They are about two-thirds of the way there - and even when they have finessed them, collecting the information on a regular basis may not be quick as gleaning GDP information.
The number-crunchers acknowledge the need for a more holistic gauge of our well-being.
GDP is three little letters that represents more than a trillion pounds of crucial and relatively easy to collect information on the financial state of our economy.
It isn't perfect, but it still has its uses.
Uber says it plans to focus more on its electric scooter and bike business, and less on cars, despite the fact it could hurt profits.
Boss Dara Khosrowshahi said that individual modes of transport were better suited to inner city travel.
He also forecast users would make more frequent shorter journeys in future.
During rush hour, it is very inefficient for a one-tonne hulk of metal to take one person 10 blocks, he told the Financial Times .
Short-term financially, maybe it's not a win for us, but strategically long term we think that is exactly where we want to head.
The ride-sharing firm has invested in a number of bike firms in the last year.
Its Jump electric bikes are now available in eight US cities, including New York and Washington, and are soon launching in Berlin.
It also teamed up with Lime, an electric scooter company, while forging deals in other areas such as public transit and freight.
Mr Khosrowshahi admitted that Uber makes less money from a bike ride than from the same trip in a car, but said this would be offset as customers used the app more frequently for shorter journeys.
We are willing to trade off short-term per-unit economics for long-term higher engagement, he told the FT.
He also acknowledged that Uber drivers could lose out from the plan, but said over the longer term drivers would benefit from more lucrative longer journeys.
Under pressure Uber, which lost $4.5bn (£3.5bn) last year, is under pressure to improve its finances ahead of an anticipated public listing.
Revenue from its taxi business is rising but the cost of expansion into new areas such as bike sharing and food delivery has meant losses have grown rapidly.
Regulatory pressure is also threatening growth in some markets.
This month New York voted to impose a temporary cap on new licences for ride-hailing vehicles to tackle congestion, while the mayor of London has said he will seek similar restrictions.
He had to borrow from a loan shark at a very high interest rate to pay off a VND10 billion ($433,000) loan to a bank.
I borrowed more than VND10 billion from four people at an interest rate of more than 7.5 percent a month or over 91 percent a year, he said.
When Hung delayed interest payment and was unable to pay the principle he and his family were threatened by loan shark lenders.
He had to sell off his factory to pay the debt, which had zoomed to VND30 billion.
Hung's company is only one of many SMEs in Vietnam borrowing from the informal market and getting caught in high interest rate traps.
Dau Anh Tuan, head of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industrys (VCCI) legal department, said 87 percent of enterprises said banks required them to have collateral for loans.
Banks refused to lend as the firms' reputation is not enough to be a guarantee for the loans, he said.
According to the 2016 VCCI Provincial Competitiveness Index, 52 percent of businesses borrow from banks, and the rest from relatives, friends or loan sharks.
According to the central bank's estimate, the total amount of black credit, as lending by the informal credit sector is known, is around VND2.5 trillion ($108 million).
Faced with a situation of businesses and individuals having to borrow from loan sharks and others at usurious interest rates, the State Bank of Vietnam has just announced a credit package of VND5 trillion ($216 million) to be routed through state-owned Agribank to serve their immediate needs and bring them into the formal credit sector.
The central banks Deputy Governor, Dao Minh Tu, has instructed Agribank to quickly disburse loans from this package, especially in rural areas.
He said the lender should have very simple conditions and procedures and quickly approve the loans.
The lending mechanism must be fast - it should be reviewed in one day - and the maximum loan amount is around VND30 million ($1,294).
Water companies have set out plans to cut bills for millions of consumers in England and Wales.
Severn Trent and United Utilities said they would cut the average bill by 5% and 10.5% respectively.
Thames Water said bills would be unchanged.
South West Water said it would offer customers a stake in the business.
The plans are being submitted by water companies in England and Wales to the regulator Ofwat for the five years between 2020-2025.
Ofwat will publish an assessment of each company's plan in January 2019.
Water UK, the lobby group for the industry in the UK, summarised the plans submitted to Ofwat by the nine main providers and a number of smaller providers in England.
It found average domestic water bills were planned to fall by more than 4% in real terms across England as a whole.
The regulator said in December that the results of its price review would result in a cut in bills between £15 and £25 a year from 2020 to 2025.
Since privatisation in 1989, water bills have risen above inflation by about 40% and the regulator has faced criticism for overestimating the costs incurred by water companies, which have been taken into account by Ofwat during its price reviews.
The latest price review was announced at a time when the Labour party had been discussing taking companies into public ownership .
John Russell, Ofwat senior director for strategy and planning, said: We've reached a milestone in our price review process.
From now and until January 2019 we'll pore over each and every business plan and we'll be looking for evidence that they are robust, ambitious and, crucially, that they have been shaped by customers.
Share ownership Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, said that while bills would be flat over the five-year period being reviewed it intended to invest some £2.1bn to boost resilience and reduce leakage after it was fined £120 million in June over leakage failures .
In the North West of England, customers of United Utilities are being promised a 10.5% reduction on average bills in real terms and 250,000 fewer households in water poverty by 2025.
Severn Trent said the 5% fall in real terms it was promising its 8.1 million customers was the largest in two decades.
Its 200,000 customers at its Welsh operation Hafren Dyfrdwy Cyfyngedig, though, will incur bill rises of 2.2%, although it said these would still be the lowest in Wales.
Welsh Water, which has three million customers across most of Wales, Herefordshire and parts of Deeside and Cheshire, said average bills should fall by 5% by 2025 and that costs would be reduced by 10% to help fund the cut.
At South West Water, average customer bills are being forecast to fall by 11% and for 9% at its Bournemouth Water arm by 2025.
Anglian bills rise South West Water also sets out a first of a kind plan to offer customers a stake in the business from 2020 and the prospect of meetings where customers can cast votes.
Customers could be given an option, alongside bill reductions, rebates and reinvestment, to have shares in parent company Pennon or a stake in South West Water itself.
Anglian Water said its bills would rise - but by less than 1%.
The region receives only two thirds of the national average rainfall.
Ofwat has required companies to set out how much they intend to invest, what they will charge customers, how they will support vulnerable customers and how they will ensure their infrastructure is resilient for the long-term.
Water UK said water companies in England intended to cut leakage by more than 16% over the five years.
This is the biggest leakage programme for 20 years and would save the equivalent of 184 Olympic-size swimming pools of water every day by 2025, Water UK said.
Would you switch to drinking camel milk?
Australia's growing number of camel farmers are hoping to persuade you.
It's not unusual for the owners of a small, close-knit business to treat their workers as an extension of their family.
Of course those members of staff aren't usually of the four-legged, one-humped variety.
Lauren Brisbane is the owner of QCamel, Australia's only certified organic commercial camel milk dairy.
Camel milk production has become one of Australia's emerging agricultural industries, as demand for the product grows both locally and internationally.
However, Lauren says her family-owned and run operation isn't driven by commercial influences - it's motivated by love.
We have a different philosophy in how we run our dairy, she says of the Queensland-based farm.
It is paramount when running a happy and healthy camel dairy to really understand and respect the camels.
We see them as our family members and fellow members of staff, rather than just stock or machinery.
They're like people, they've all got a different personality.
They're gentle souls, kind and loving, and just so intelligent.
You can sit and talk to them about what's going on, and they completely understand.
They're a huge animal… but if you respect that kindness and intelligence, they're easy to work with.
Increasing numbers of Australian farmers are choosing to keep the country's prolific ships of the desert.
The camel was first introduced to Australia in the 1840s to assist in the exploration of the country's vast interior or outback.
There are now thought to be more than 1.2 million in the wild, which is considered to be the world's largest feral population.
They are mostly the dromedary or Arabian camel, which has one hump, and is the species chosen for milk production.
Australia also has a much smaller wild population of the two humped Bactrian camel.
Australia's first camel dairies opened in 2014, and since then the industry has grown considerably, with dairies now operating in almost every state and territory.
While global camel milk production is dominated by countries in North and East Africa, and the Middle East, a 2016 report by the Australian government predicted that the five years to 2021 are expected to see a major increase in Australian camel milk production.
Back in 2016 the country produced 50,000 litres of camel milk, compared with 180,000 litres per annum today.
Megan Williams has certainly helped drive that growth.
She and her husband Chris set up a dairy in northern Victoria towards the end of 2014, with just three camels from the wild, which they subsequently had to train to be milked.
Five years later their business - The Camel Milk Co Australia - has moved to a property more than twice the size.
They now have a herd of more than 300 camels, with around 60 currently being milked.
The farm averages around six litres of milk per camel per day.
One third of that is sent overseas to customers in Singapore, with shipments of both fresh and powdered milk about to expand into Thailand and Malaysia.
China and the US are on the list of potential future markets for Megan, while other camel milk producers across Australia are exporting to destinations including New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Hong Kong.
We're probably doing a couple of hundred litres for export each week, but with Thailand coming on board, that's set to really increase, says Megan.
More often than not, we are approached by international buyers and their markets.
One thing Australia has over any other country in the world is our camels are disease-free.
The disease Megan is referring to is the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus, which can break out in camel populations in the Middle East.
The virus can spread to humans from contact with camels, or by consuming raw camel milk, and is potentially fatal.
While camel milk has been consumed by humans for more than 6,000 years, worldwide demand has grown markedly in recent years, despite its expensive nature.
One litre of pasteurised camel milk retails for about A$15 ($10; £8) in Australia, making it 12 times more expensive than cow's milk.
The recent increase in interest in camel milk has been led by consumers seeking the milk's supposed health benefits.
On a nutritional level, camel milk is richer than cow's milk in vitamin C, vitamin B, iron, calcium, magnesium and potassium.
Other properties attributed to camel milk, according to the 2016 Australian Government market assessment, include its attributed capacity to alleviate food and seasonal allergies, usefulness in reducing insulin dependency and the treatment of diabetes, and ease of digestion.
Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Rebecca Forwood has been importing Australian camel milk into Singapore for almost two years and believes in its benefits.
I hate the term 'superfood', but this really is up there as one of the best, she says.
Since selling it ourselves we average about 160-200 one litre bottles a month, and the numbers are growing as more people are discovering its healing benefits.
Charlene Grosse, accredited practising dietician and spokesperson for the Dietitians Association of Australia, says that while camel milk is certainly nutritionally valuable, more research is needed to put some of the other claims to the test.
When you look at camel milk it's just like cow's milk, it is very nutritious, she says.
It's low in cholesterol and it's low sugar, so it can be a healthy substitute to cow's milk, but what we do need to be aware of is there's not enough research at the moment to back up some of the claims being made about camel's milk.
Regardless of the need for more studies Megan says one thing is certain - the future for this unexpected Australian export industry is certainly bright.
In addition to milk, the sector is also starting to make cheeses, skincare products, and chocolate made with camel milk.
Every week we get a new contact or a new inquiry, and it just keeps growing.
But what is camel milk like?
It is said to be similar in colour and texture to cow's milk, but with a slightly saltier taste.
Carmaker Ford is expanding production of all-electric vehicles after deciding that rapid growth in market meant it needed to accelerate its plans.
It is investing about $900m (£682m) in new production capacity at a plant in Michigan, creating about 900 jobs.
Head of global operations Joe Hinrichs said it had taken a fresh look at the growth in electric vehicles.
Ford, the number two US carmaker, also said it would start production of autonomous vehicles in about two years.
The company has been in talks with Germany's Volkswagen about an alliance to invest and built electric and autonomous vehicles.
Mr Hinrichs said the talks had been positive, but there was nothing to announce.
Last year, Ford set out a long-term plan to invest about $11bn in new vehicle technologies.
Mr Hinrichs told reporters: When we were taking a look at our $11bn investment in electrification, it became obvious to us that we were going to need a second plant in the not-too-distant future to add capacity for our battery electric vehicles.
The latest investment will focus on Ford's Flat Rock plant in south-east Michigan, which employs about 3,400 people building the Mustang and Lincoln Continental cars.
Ford was already planning an all-electric sport utility vehicle in 2020 that will be built at its factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico.
In January, the company said it wanted to have about 40 hybrid and all-electric cars in its model line-up by 2022 - about 16 of which will be fully electric.
As we ramp up AV production, this plan allows us to adjust our investment spending to accommodate the pace of growth of this exciting new technology, Mr Hinrichs said.
Carmakers are investing heavily in alternative vehicle (AV) technology because of pressure from regulators in the US, China and Europe to cut carbon emissions.
The recent Geneva Motor Show, which Ford did not attend, was dominated by the unveiling of new electric cars and concepts.
It's been called the most successful company in history.
